Author notes:

This e-book does not contain a chapter heading, such like, Chapter One; Chapter Two, etc.

Instead, the story unfolds in a numeric calendar date format with current time, daylight or nighttime hours, a set of current weather conditions, and the property location with character activity.

I enjoy learning parts and pieces of an unread novel before diving into the content.

430,000 years ago, in a cave within present-day country of Spain, a fossilized skull had been uncovered and exhibited physical evidence from a blunt force blew at the forehead on a human creating the world's first homicide murder.

In the field of criminal law, a victim of a crime is an individual who has been harmed by another individual, not a society with numerous people. Sometime, the criminal of the crime gets away with the murder, which seems unfair to the victim, but that is how legal justice system words.

This shared information is a part of living as a lawful or unlawful citizen of the world which makes for a set of intriguing police work, an intruding pubic announcement and sometimes, a fascinating fictitious novel.

I have created a rating system for each one of my novels for the curious reader.

Rated G for good stuff.

Rated PG for pretty good stuff.

Rated M for mild stuff.

Rated R for really great stuff.

Rated V for vile stuff.

Rated C for cute stuff.

This storyline is Rated R for really great acts of violence including spilled blood and torn guts, numerous weapons of death, witty humor, nasty female catfights, ugly male dogfights, and lots of deaths, but no ghosts.

The major character role involves a set of seventeen-year-old high school teenagers and their immediately family clan members.

Each seventeen-year-old is attending the local high school building and studying to pass the last academic test for a permanent working job with the society.

The major scientific breakthrough, the earthly resources are almost depleted on the surface of the planet. Thus, each person wears a redesigned set of used clothing or eats from a reconstructed set of broken dishes and lives inside a reengineered house.

And each individual wears a com-d device somewhere on their body part that communicates with your friend or your assigned homework assignments or your mother.

Inside each house, a ceiling to floor black tinted glass screen allows each individual to learn each school education lesson or enjoy an entertainment show.

This place is a future spot on Planet Earth that provides a flying hover car, a com-d communication devise, and a regulated world of law and order for each man, woman, teen, child, infant, and family pet.

Thanks for entering into my imagination!

Teenly action and adventure and love and hate...

A society is perfect. A citizen is not.

Society City Four has rules for everyone, including the infants, the teens, the adults, and the family pets.

When a lawful citizen of Society claims any minor or major crime against another lawful citizen, the two parties go to Zulu Time.

Zulu Time is the time and place for justice, without a judge, a jury, and an executioner of fairness, sometimes, with an unhappy ending for all.

Within Society City Four, seventeen-year-old Igala Smith is a student at Hall, a place to test for a re-generator job to make a living for coin at the age of eighteen years old.

She just received a car for her birthday, rolling her friends around the Hall grounds and then the car runs into the rear bumper of another vehicle.

Igala does not sweat off her vanilla smelling perfume.

Cute teen-hunk male classmate Ucal comes to the rescue and pays the coin for the car damage on the other vehicle for Igala.

And then everything is fine.

This e-book is a wickedly cool concept of crime and punishment for both the criminal and the victim, all at the same time, and all in the same place, which is called Zulu Time.

And then everything is fine.

This wicked story is a crime and punishment event for both the criminal and the victim all at the same time and in the same place, which is called Zulu Time.
Present day and place and time

Society City Four

Zulu Time Building

Cool temperatures and clear night sky of bright stars

Interior tan color room

"Aim high," the adult female squatted down and whispered into the cheekbone of the young child, reaching up with a pair of golden colored gloves, pushing the barrel tip up into the air inside a pair of small pink-tinted gloved hands of the young child.

The four-year-old female child wore a face of hollow hearts in the colors of blue and pink, standing on both kneecaps on top of a soft cushion on the floor in a pink sparkling dress. Both her naked elbows were buried deep inside the soft matting of the bench seat. She frowned at the gun. "It's heavy."

The room was fashioned into a backward D-shape letter with one continuous wall, curving into a solid forward wall. The curved wall was colored in tan, without a single piece of pretty art work or a viewing window of trees and sunlight. The forward wall in front of the four-year-old child with the hand gun was long and straight, holding a set of upright objects.

The female whispered into the cheekbone child without a smile. "Only a little bit. Do you see the three objects on the rear wall of the room?"

"Yeah..."

"There is a great big object on your right side. There is a medium sized object in the middle. And there is a small object on your left side. Each object has an oval shaped middle. The oval is split with two colors. The bright red tape is on top of the oval shape. The light tan colored tape is on bottom of the oval shape. There are a set of two straight lines which are falling down to the floor, coming from the oval shape which is taped in the color of tan also. Coming from the both sides of the oval shape, there are two more straight lines which are taped in the color of tan also. Do you see that?"

"Yeah..."

"On top of the oval shape, there is a much smaller round shape which is colored in red tape too. Do you see that, also?"

"Yeah..."

"Good. You are to hit the bright red tape inside the oval shape or the smaller round shape of red color anywhere you want. Okay?"

"Okay."

"Good. Aim the end of the barrel at the red colored tape. Press the trigger with both your index fingers. Then you will hear and feel a pop. Don't worry. It is supposed to pop with a loud sound. Do you understand?"

The child whined. "Can I cover my ears?"

"No. You are wearing a pair of earplugs inside each eardrum, so I can talk to you in a whisper. And the earplugs will muffle the loud sound. Don't be scared."

"Okay."

"Good. Press the trigger now."

The child pressed the trigger with her tiny fingers with a cringe. The gun discharged with a single bullet toward the wall, hitting one of the tan colored straight lines.

"Aww..." A voice of the male, the first object on the forward wall screamed into the empty room.

The child dropped the gun onto the soft cushion, covering both eardrums with a puzzled brow, staring at the wiggling large tan and red colored object on the forward wall. "It...it sounds like a ghost. Is that a ghost on the wall?"

The female said without emotion. "No. It is the man of the vehicle that hit and killed your mom and your dad and your baby sister."

The little girl pouted. "He is the bad ghost."

The straight line of tan colored tape turned black as the male voice moaned throughout the room, again.

"He is not a ghost yet. Pick up the gun and aim it at the red colored tape on the oval shape of the object. Press the trigger again. Okay?"

"Okay." The child picked up the gun, aiming the barrel at the red tape on the oval shape, pressing the trigger. A second bullet hit the tan color of the large oval shape.

"Ooo..." A same male voice, the first object on the forward wall screamed in pain inside the empty room as a portion of the tan colored oval shaped wiggled side to side and turned into a rich black color, too.

The female said without emotion, "Pretty good. You are almost to the red colored tape. When you hit the red colored tape, it will turn black. Okay. Lift and aim the barrel at the red tape on the oval shape."

The child held the gun between both hands as both her elbows rested deeply inside the soft matting, so her arms would not move. She fired the gun for a third time. The bullet hit the red colored tape on the left side of the oval shape, a human male.

"Waah...." The same voice of the male screamed as both of his tan colored arms and one leg flung side to side in the air. Then his body slumped forward from the tan colored wall, without falling over the tan colored floor. All the red taped turned into the color of black. The body of male was covered in tan and red sticky tape from his hair roots down to his toenails.

The child dropped the gun and covered both ears with a puzzled brow.

"You have finished your task, young child." The adult female snatched the gun from the cushion, grabbing and lifted the child to stand upright, whispering into the ear plug without emotion. "Okay. You can go and sit against the empty spot on the rear wall which is behind me and watch your brother." She back stepped from the low sitting bench of tan colors and stopped, staring at the forward wall in silence.

Her brother moved ahead from the entrance wall with a stern face and squatted on both kneecaps, extending both arms in the air. The child spun around with a smile, running toward her brother for a hug. Her brother released her and stood upright from the floor. She scooted around her brother and ran toward the back wall and turned, sitting down over the floor, watching the back spine of her brother.

Her brother shuffled ahead with a stern face and stopped, standing beside the golden tinted nose profile of the female in golden colors, staring at the three objects on the forward wall in silence.

The adult female colored in coppery golden skin with a bald head turned with a stern face to see the nose profile of the brother. "You are allowed to finish the rest of the wall of criminals. What is your desired weapon, young teen?"

The brother of the little girl wore a sea green colored tuxedo with a pair of gray hand gloves, and a matching bowtie with a set of silly black and gray skulls on each cheekbone and an exposed throat neck, marching forward toward the low sitting bench of tan colors, working a jaw line as the skulls sounded with a deep baritone laugh of evil into his eardrums only. He stopped and stood in front of the bench, leaning down, slapping the top of the soft fabric of the cushioned bench in front of the medium sized object on the wall of criminals. The cushion lid lifted upward and revealed an array of weapons at the bottom of the cabinet interior, consisting of guns, knives, arrows, axes, and other deadly instruments of death.

He reached down and grabbed an array of weapons, placing each one on the floor, standing upright and slapped the cushion lid down. The upright lid slowly dropped back down over the chest lip. He leaned down and grabbed the manual bow and arrow from the floor, standing upright, positioning the weapon against a shoulder and aimed at the medium sized object. He released the bow. The single arrow soared through the air waves and pierced the tan colored tape right below the red colored tape at the stomach region of the oval shaped object on the forward wall.

"Aww..." A voice of the female, the second object on the forward wall screamed in horror as the tan colored tape on the medium sized object turned red. The four straight tan colored objects flung side to side into the air and against the wall in pain also.

He whispered with a sneer at the medium sized second object on the wall of criminals. "That's for my dead mom." He leaned down and grabbed a second arrow, standing upright, reloading the bow with another arrow and aimed at the red colored tape on the third medium sized object on the forward wall. He released the bow again. The second arrow hit the red colored tape which was the heart region of the third medium sized object on the wall of criminals.

"Arrgh..." The voice of the young female, the third object on the forward wall yelled in pain as the red colored tape turned black inside the heart region on the oval shape.

He whispered with a sneer. "That's for my dead dad." The brother of the little girl and the son of a set of dead parents dropped the bow on over the top of the cushion, reaching down to the floor, grabbing a set of knives and stood upright, working the jaw line of bones and skulls. His eardrums heard the evil laugh again. He side stepped in front the bench even with the smallest object in tan colors, hearing the whimpers of the smallest object on the forward wall inside the quiet room, turning with a stern face to see his sister on the wall behind his back spine.

She sat against the wall over the floor, playing with her fingers in boredom. She did not understand that her parents were dead from a terrible car accident, yesterday.

He swung around with a sneer, lifting and aimed the first knife, releasing a hand gripe. The knife sailed through the air waves and hit the tan colored taped on the smallest object on the forward wall which turned into rich black color.

"Ahh...." The voice of the child, the last and smallest object on the wall of criminals yelled and cried in pain, flinging a wounded right leg side to side in the air along with the other leg. However, the knife had stuck through the bone and the skin of the child.

The brother whispered with a sneer. "That was for my dead baby sister." He reached down and grabbed, lifting and aimed a second knife, releasing a gripe. The second knife hit the red colored tape at the rib cage as the red color did not turn into a new color.

"Eeyah..." The voice of the child, the last and smallest object on the wall of criminals screamed in terror and cried in pain, flinging one tan colored tape leg and one tan colored taped arm side to side in the air.

The brother reaches down over the bench seat and grabbed, lifting, and aimed a third knife at the red colored taped on the last and smallest round oval on the forward wall, releasing a hand gripe. The third knife soared through the empty space and hit the red colored tape in the middle of the head as the red colored taped turned rich black hue.

"Pfft..." The voice of the child, the last and smallest object on the wall of criminals exhausted with a last breath, displaying a set of numerous black colors and did not move or cry anymore.

The brother stared with a sour frown and a sneer at each non-moving oval shaped that was colored in rich black on the forward wall of criminals, turning to the side, mouthing spat onto the floor.

The lights turned rich black colors inside the room of tan colors.

Inside the dark room, the brother spun around to see his sister on the curved wall, moving ahead and stopped, squatting down to the floor. He reached out and gently grabbed, lifting up and toted her on his hip with a worried brow and a set of whispers into her face, leaving the Zulu Time room of tan colors within the darkness.

A few seconds later, the over head lamps illuminated with light into an empty room of tan color. The forward wall was cleared of all dead bodies and any leaked blood which was rare, draining out from the super glue sticky colored tape. Usually, all the blood proteins were absorbed directly into the tape which held all the human blood until the dead body was lifted and placed over a medical cot for the quick removal process, coming out from the Zulu Time room.

A set of two doors opened.

Two separate adult females advanced, coming from an individual side door on the opposite side of the curved wall, dashing into the middle of the continuous soft fabric sitting bench which was really a hidden chest of deadly weapons. They twirled around and around with a smile and a hand wave to see each tiny black colored glass screen that measured six inches by six inches. The dark skinned female wore an ankle-length gown of red with two cheekbone facial designs of solid patterned yellow and green sunflowers, and a ponytail of black hair with a set of red, orange, and grey streaks of color. Her face painted sunflower designs whistled a musical soprano tone.

The other female was pale tinted and wore an ankle-length gown of blue with a face and a neck design of individual painted orange and purple outline of snow flakes, and a head of long blonde hair with a set of wiggled lines of pink and green colors. Her face paint of colorful snowflakes sung a baritone musical tone when both the cheekbones smiled.

They twirled around and met in the middle of the room, stopping, saying in unison into each tiny six inches of glass screen. "It is done. Thank you for visiting Zulu Time. I hoped that you have enjoyed the evening program. Good night from Jaime and Jackie Jones until tomorrow night."

Then the room went black.
279th day of the year

07:07 pm (early evening)

Warm temperatures and blue and green sunset

House of seventeen-year-old Minki

Supper time setting

She lounged in front of a black tinted wall of glass, eating the supper meal on top of the individual wooden tray, sitting in a row with her father, her mother, and two older brothers, chewing the good food. She lifted up and taped on her necklace communication device or com-d. She possessed a head of blonde hair with wiggling lines of yellow, black, and purple colors and a tone of yellow skin with pink, purple, and yellow outlines of butterfly facial designs, and a mouth of braces for her crooked teeth with a metal smile. She smiled into her com-d at the other image. "Hey, Igala. Are you watching...?"

The naked bulb in the wall corner illuminated in yellow tone first and then the bell softly rang in pings throughout the house next.

"Bye, Igala. See you in Hall, tomorrow." Minki disconnected the com-d, smiling and eating her supper, staring at the wall of glass (television screen) at the new entertainment program.

The black colored glass wall covered the entire wall, coming from the ceiling down to the floor and then illuminated in an array of wiggling red and green colors. The voices of two individual females chimed in unison which echoed through the living room of Minki. _"Welcome to Zulu Time, the place for just and justice."_

Zulu Time Building

Interior tan colored room

A set of two doors opened on each side of a curved tan colored continuous wall inside the interior of the Zulu Time room.

A pale skinned female exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female exited from the other side door as both females moved across the tan colored hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile and a hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jaime and Jackie Jones."

Jackie twirled around in a circle with a smile and a nod to see each tiny black colored glass screen, wearing an off-the-shoulder ankle-length emerald colored dress and a pair of elbow-length matching gloves. Her pale face, a neck, both back shoulder blades, and a naked collar bone were painted in a set of outlined star designs of red, pink, green, black, blue, yellow, and orange. Her blonde hair was pulled back into a long ponytail, swaying side to side in streaks of green, red, blue, and yellow colors. "I am Jackie. Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice. We will explain the rules for any new audience viewers. When an injustice has occurred, each party is presented here at the Zulu Time Building."

Jamie swirled around in a strapless ankle-length yellow colored dress and a pair of matching elbow-length gloves. Her dark skin shined in a set of solid painted triangles over numerous body parts, including a face, a neck, both back shoulder blades, and a collar bone of varied colors, consisting of green, pink, yellow, blue, orange, red, and purple. Her long black colored hair was piled on top of her hair roots in the colors of pink, green, red, yellow, and white. "I am Jamie. Then, each party is allowed to voice their justification case within a twenty-second time period in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and ate your supper time meal. After twenty seconds has ended, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for the criminal or the letter of V for the victim."

Then each female turned with a smile and moved back to a closed door on the opposite wall.

The first door opened.

Jaime swung around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of people of eight members in front of a long bench of soft fabric and stopped. Each person stopped and scanned the room with a set of sneers, finger pointing around the Zulu Time room, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of dark blue color. Each face was decorated in a set of colorful outlines of squares, circles, and other fun geometric figures.

The second door opened.

Jackie spun around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of people of eight members in front of the same long bench of soft beige fabric and stopped. Each person in the party stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of mumbles and grunts, turning and pointing to each tiny glass screen on the curved wall, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of magenta pink color. Each face was decorated in a set of colorful outlines of birds, bees, and other fun insects-like figures.

Jamie and Jackie turned and met in middle of the room a smile and a nod, twirling with a hand wave to see each glass screen too.

Jackie stopped the twirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of pretty pink. My twin sister Jamie stands behind to Cee team. The Vee team claims that the daughter was rejected and jilted by the former fiancé. Now, no other person will marry her ever. Her life is ruined without a happiness marriage and a child. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice their individual justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty-second time period. Since, each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jaime stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod to each glass screen, holding the microphone. "I am Jaime. I stand behind the of Cee team with their family members in the color of cool dark blue. It is important to remember which party you are rooting for in this justification case. You have twenty seconds to state your justification case to the viewers of Society City Four."

Jackie turned with a smile and handed the microphone to the young adult female of the Vee team as her sister Jamie turned and handed her microphone to the young adult male of the Cee team. They back stepped from the bench and the two debating teams of words, standing against a small empty space on the tan colored curved wall between the rows of tiny glass screens. Each tiny screen was six inches long by six inches wide that contained a face of a registered viewer, hiding between a wall of glass inside a living room to see and hear the world, especially the world of Society City Four.

The twins stared at the nose profile of each team member, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The young adult girl of the Vee team wore an ankle-length gown of hot pink with a one matching elbow glove, and a pair of matching spiked heels. Each cheekbone displayed a set of hollowed out colorful black and yellow bumblebee outline. She jabbed a re-designer fake fingernail at her former fiancé with a sneer as she barely heard the sweet hum of the bumblebees on her painted face. The fun face paint sung and moved with the bones of the face. "He won't marry me. He took back my big diamond engagement ring, ripping it away from me. Actually, he stole it from my hand during lunch one day at our re-generator work office. Now, I'm ruined. I had sex with him. I am not a virgin anymore..."

"Naw," The young adult male of the Cee team wore a dark blue tuxedo with a pair of lavender hand gloves and a matching bowtie. His cheekbones and a forehead wore a set of hollowed out colorful orange squares. He pointed at his former finance with a sneer, without hearing the zing of the squares over a forehead and both cheekbones inside his eardrums. "She's a whore. She had sex with my best friend while we were engaged. My best friend told me all about it, cunt. Every single juicy detail dropped from his lips literally, bitch."

The woman of the Vee team, she cried with wet tears, running down both her cheekbones, smearing the black and yellow bumblebee paint with a sad pout and a sneer. "The bastard refused to marry me after I lost my virginity. I can't get my virginity back. We've been dating for one year and two months. He promised a ring, a wedding, a honeymoon and a house. Now, now, I'm a whore. No other male will date or marry me. I want Zulu Time to serve me justice, now."

He sneered. "Cunt, she cheated on me. So I called off our love relationship. That means no ring, no wedding, no honeymoon, and no house. Now, I'm the one free to date a nice girl that I want."

The room went black as the voices of the two people went silent.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile in unison inside the darkness. "The deadline of twenty seconds has expired."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only."

The voice of Jamie said with a smile inside the darkness. "If the final number is an exact mathematical tie for both teams, which does happen occasionally, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl. Please illuminate all the screens now inside Zulu Time."

All the tiny six inched glass screens showed a black background with a single alphabetic letter in blazing white.

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness, seeing all the letters on the glass screens. "Wow, I see. Do you see? It is very interesting, Jackie."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated tiny glass screens too. "Yes, I see, too. Do you see, too, Jamie?"

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison, "The highest mathematical number inside each glass screen wins the justification case here tonight. The highest amount is the letter C for the criminal team."

The tiny glass screens of light turned into darkness. The dark room echoed in a series of loud screams and harsh curses plus the sounds of soft rips and tears of fabric. Then, the room was silent.

At few seconds later, the overhead lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room, again.

On the forward wall, there were eight objects that stood in height from tallest down towards shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages, cascading down from the hair roots to the pinky toes. There was a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull which hid the eyeballs, the lips, the nose holes, the ear holes, and the colored hair roots of the individual. However, the object could breathe through the sticky tape, softly moaning like a ghost and wiggled side to side slapping the wall with all limbs.

In front of the low sitting bench of soft fabric colored that was mounted from wall-to-wall, the Cee team stood in a tight huddle with a series of whispered mumbles and turned, finger pointing at each wiggling oval shaped object on the forward wall.

Jackie twirled around to see each six inched glass screen on the curvy wall with a smile in the pretty evening gown. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, the Cee team must participate and accept the judgment of the citizens of Society City Four. Thus, the Vee team has lost the justification case here tonight. Now, each Vee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of tan and the pretty color of red against the forward wall for the true justice of the Cee team. Each Vee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment too. Thus, Vee team is sentenced to death by means of the Cee team's fun and creative methods."

Jamie swirled around to see each glass screen too with a smile in the pretty evening gown also. "Cee team, please select your pleasure. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. There is an array of guns, an assortment of big to small knives, a box of arrow with a bow, and some nasty looking pick axes with deadly spikes, and other types of punishment lethal items. Hmm, I do not know what to pick in this instant either. But it is not my choice ever. This part of Zulu Time is choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Cee team member must fire one weapon at one oval shaped object and kill the wiggling object on the forward wall. A Cee team member will know a kill shot has occurred when the oval shaped object has turned into the color of rich black, covering the tan or red tape."

The young male of the Cee team with a face of hollow colored squares moved forward, slapping down the lid. The lid lifted upright and halted. He looked down to see an array of weapons that was located inside the deep cabinet of the sitting bench, reaching down, grabbing a hand gun, lifting it, and handed a gun to each of his family members, until each family member held a weapon. He stood upright and held the gun, side stepping toward the beginning of the long bench, waving a hand at each family member.

Jamie stopped the twirl and back stepped with her sister from the back spines of Cee team members, saying with a smile and a nod. "O. This is very clever and convenience. There are eight members of the Vee team and eight members of Cee team. So each member of Cee team is standing directly in front of a wiggling object on the forward wall, holding a gun in their hands."

Jackie stopped the whirl and smiled with a nod and a smile at the wall of criminals. "So we need to scurry out of the way of death, Jamie. The Regulators are required assistance within this Zulu Time activity. They will come and issue a set of earplugs and check the safety latch on all the hand guns for each kill shot."

Each female turned to the side with a smile and dashed toward the open door on the opposite side of the curved wall.

A set of eight Regulators moved ahead, coming out from the criminal side door, stopping, standing next to each Cee team member, handing out a pair of earplugs and clicked of the gun safety without an emotion or a vocal word. Then the row of Regulators spun around and left the room, moving back into the criminal side door. A Regulator wore a one-piece jumpsuit of coppery golden color that matched their skin tone and their golden bald head of absent hair, serving as a peacemaker for Society City Four.

Jackie and Jaime stood inside the open archway and out of the way, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Aim high."

They back stepped and moved back into the dark tunnel for safety and protection.

Then both the doors closed shut and tight.

The young adult male of the Cee team lifted and held up a free hand with a grunt for the signal and then dropped the hand down to his leg in silence.

A red colored blaze of bullets released from each gun and hit each wiggling object on the forward wall as each tan colored oval object turned into the color of rich black. And then the red taped area turned into the color of rich black also.

The room went black.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "It is done."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "Thank you for participating in this process. However, the night is still young."

The voice of Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "We have lots more judgments for you. Please stay on-line as we clean up the Zulu Time room."

The wall of glass inside each home within Society City Four modified into a set of zigzag lines of pale blue, dark green, and silver with a set of drums and trumpets of a jazz song of musical notes. The voices of Jackie and Jamie chimed in unison within the darkness, "Welcome to Zulu Time, the place for just and justice."

A few minutes later, the lights illuminated down into an empty and clean floor of tan again inside the Zulu Time room.

The Cee team door slid open first.

Jamie exited from an open archway with a smile, leading a line of four people in front of a low and long bench of soft beige fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of mumbles and grunts, turning and pointing to each tiny television plasma screen on the curved wall, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of olive green color. Each face was decorated in a set of colorful outlines of dog and cat faces with whiskers and pointy ears.

The Vee team door slid open next.

Jackie exited from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of people in front of the same long bench of soft fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room and then the opposing party with a set of sneers, finger pointing on the other side of the room, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of garnet red color. Each face was decorated in a set of colorful outlines of angel wings.

Jackie raised a hand with a smile and a nod to see each glass screen, holding the microphone. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of furious red. In this particular justification crime, there are animals involved also. The vicious dogs of the Cee team had mutated and killed two precious children of the Vee team in cold blooded murder. Therefore, the Vee team asks and seeks just and justice in Zulu Time."

Jaime raised an arm with a smile and a nod to the see each glass screen, holding the microphone. "I am Jaime. I stand behind the Cee team with their family members and their two precious dogs too in the color of cool green. It is important to remember which party you are rooting for in this justification case. You have twenty seconds to state your justification case to all the viewers within Society City Four."

Jackie and Jaime back stepped from the bench and the two debating teams, stopping and stood against an empty space on the curved wall between the rows of glass screens, saying with a smile and a nod in unison. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The older woman of the Vee team wore an ankle-length gown of garnet red with a set of orange and red angel wings on a face, a neck, and a collar bone. She held a microphone and turned with a sneer, jabbing a garnet red colored gloved finger at the elderly man of Cee team. "He killed my precious boys with those vicious ugly dogs in cold blooded murder. The dogs had blood stains over their face and their coats when the Regulators came to investigate the killing, my boys and their blood. My babies are dead, because of you and him and those damn dogs." She wailed and sobbed with tears of her loss of kin.

The elderly man of Cee team wore an olive green colored tuxedo with a set of yellow and black dog faces on a face and a neck. He held a microphone with a sneer, flinging an arm in the air with a sneer. "No. Your mean boys climbed over my fence post, kicking dirt and tossing food at my dogs. My dogs were protecting me and my property. You are to blame for the deaths of your mean boys. I told ya and told ya to keep your boys off my personal private property plot of land, ma'am."

The older woman of the Vee team cried with her tears into the microphone. "My boys are dead. Nothing will bring them back to me here on the planet. But I can send you to burn down in hell for killing my precious ten year sons. You and all your family members and your damn dogs..."

The elderly man of the Cee team cried with his tears over the microphone. "I love my dogs. My dogs are nice and well behaved. Look at them on the floor beside my boot. They sit and are quiet. And they are more well behaved than your two rotten mean kids from no-good nothing," sneering.

The room went black as the voices faded into silent.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The deadline of twenty seconds has expired. You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only. If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl. Please illuminate all the glass screens now inside Zulu Time."

All the screens showed a black back ground with one single letter in blazing white.

The voice of Jamie said with a smile in the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Whoa, I am shocked. Are your shocked, Jackie?"

The voice of Jackie said with a smile in the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens also. "Yip, I am shocked, too. Are you really shocked, Jamie?"

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The highest mathematical number, coming from each exhibited glass screen, wins the justification case. The highest number of letter is C for the criminal team."

The millions of illuminated tiny glass screens went dark. The dark room echoed in a series of loud screams and harsh curses plus the sounds of soft rips and tears of fabric. Then the room was silent.

A few seconds later, the overhead lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room, again.

On the forward wall, there were four objects that stood in height from tallest down towards shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages, cascading down from the hair roots to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

Jackie twirled around to see each screen with a smile. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, each Cee team member must participate and accept the judgment. Thus, the Vee team has lost the justification case. Now, each Vee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of tan and the pretty color of red against the forward wall for just and justice of the Cee team. Each Vee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment too. Thus, the Vee team is sentenced to death by means of the Cee team's fun and creative methods on the wall of criminals."

Jamie swirled around to see each glass screen with a smile. "Cee team, please select your pleasure. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. Pick out whatever suites your heart and your hand. This part of Zulu Time is choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Cee team member must fire one weapon at one oval shaped object and kill the wiggling object on the forward wall. A Cee team member will know a kill shot has occurred when the oval shaped object has turned into the color of rich black, covering the tan or red tape. And I do believe that our evening audience of viewers is filled with nice pet owners and animal lovers, since the dogs won tonight too."

The Cee party members did not huddle into a tight group of words, turning and spreading out in front of the long bench of soft fabric. Each team member slapped the lid with a hand as the lid lifted and displayed an array of deadly weapons inside the depth of the cabinet. Each Cee member selected a different weapon and scooted sideways, standing in front of an oval shaped object against the forward wall.

Jackie stopped the twirl and smiled at the wall of criminals. "There are too many objects on the forward wall. That is not a prob, thou. Each Cee team member has a weapon and is standing in front of one object. Thus, each Cee team member will hit the object until the red tape turns into the color of black. So, the last Cee team member has the option of shooting at last two oval shaped objects against the wall of criminal. This justification case cannot be completed until all the objects have turned black on some part of the wrapped body. And the team member will start with the largest object and work their way down to the smallest object on the wall of criminals. There will be no need for a Regulator here. So, let's scat, Jamie."

"I am scatting, Jackie." Jaime stopped the swirl and smiled at the wall of criminals.

They both spun around and dashed toward the opposite side of the curved wall into the open and dark archway.

Jackie and Jaime spun around and stood inside the archway for safety with a smile and a nod in unison. "Aim high..."

Then both doors closed shut and tight.

The first Cee team member, the elderly male with a batch of tiny yellow and black dog faces on both the cheekbones and the forehead reared back an arm with the weapon, tossing a nasty pick axe at the largest oval shaped wiggling object on the forward wall.

"Aw..." The voice of the female, the first and largest on the wall of criminals cried out with pain as the tan colored body jerked side to side from the weapon impact.

The first Cee team member, an elderly man shook a skull side to side and reached down, grabbing a second weapon, lifting and reared back an arm, pitching a second nasty-looking pick axe at the largest object with a sneer.

"Uoo..." The voice of the female, the first and largest on the wall of criminals screamed out in pain as the red colored tape turned black. Then largest object did not move in the stillness of death.

The first Cee member, an elderly man turned with a smile to see the second member of the Cee team, the elderly female.

The second Cee team member, an elderly female with a series of blue, yellow, and red hollowed cat faces on her cheekbones, neck, and collar bone. She stood with a pair of jeweled sandals apart inside an ankle-length olive green sparkling gown, gritting the teeth and tossed a nasty-looking hunting knife at the red colored tape of the heart region.

The knife sliced into the red colored taped of the second object on the wall of criminals as the tape turned into rich black without a scream from the male.

The elderly female turned with a smile and a nod to see the third member of the Cee team, her daughter.

The third Cee team member, a teen female with a series of red and brown dogs on both of her cheekbones, the neckline, and the collar bone, wearing a tight fitting olive green colored ankle-length gown and whispered for her eardrums only, "My turn." Her painted dogs growled into her eardrums as she reared an arm and tossed the construction hammer at the third object on the forward wall. The hammer hit the foot of the tan colored taped on the foot region.

"Aahh..." The voice of the young female, the third object on the wall of criminals screamed in pain, wiggling side to side. The tan bandage modified into a red color that represented her blood proteins.

The third Cee team member, the teen female reached down with a sneer, grabbing and lifted, rearing back an arm and pitched a second hammer at the tan colored tape which was the kneecap of the third oval shaped object on the forward wall.

The voice of the young female, the third object on the wall of criminals yelled in pain, wiggling each tan colored taped limbs side to side with a red colored leg. "Waah..."

The third Cee team member, the teen female exhaled with a puff of disappointment, reaching down, grabbing and lifted, rearing back both each arms with a hammer, throwing both hammers at the same time at the third oval shaped object on the forward wall. One hammer hit the tan colored tape which was the rib cage. The other hammer hit the red colored tape which represented the face.

The tan and red colored continued to present in the color of red. The voice of the young female the third object on the wall of criminals wiggled her limbs and screamed in pain. "Iyhiih..."

The third Cee team member, the teen female shook her curls, reaching down, grabbing, lifted and reared back both arms and tossed two more hammers at the third object on the forward wall. She worked in a continuous motion, reaching, grabbing, lifting, and pitching an additional two hammers at the third oval shaped object on the forward wall. The four hammers hit the red colored tape which was the skull region with four licks.

The red tape turned into rich black hue. The third object on the wall of criminals, the voice of the female exhaled with a last breath into death, "Pfft..."

The third Cee team member, the teen female turned with a nod and a smile to see the dog, squatting and whispering her command into the face of the dog. "Attack now, Spot!"

One of the two dogs leaped over the bench and raced over a hard floor with a growl, leaping onto the smallest oval shaped object on the forward wall.

The voice of the young boy, the fourth object on the wall of criminals yelled in pain, flinging all limbs side to side from the vicious dog teeth, "Eeyah..."

The dog back stepped and ripped off one of the tan colored straight limbs, which was the right arm of the child that turned black and tossed the bloody limb down over the floor. Then the dog moved ahead, selecting another tan colored straight limb, which was the left leg of the child, using a set of sharp teeth. The limb turned rich black colors. Then the dog back stepped and jerked the leg off the child, splitting it on the floor too. Then the dog back stepped with an open bloody mouth and fanged teeth and ran, leaping and grabbed, biting into the skull bone of red tape of the child. The red tape of the skull turned into rich black tone.

The third Cee team, the teenage female whistled. The dog stopped and spun around with a tail wag, running back over the floor to its new kinder mistress with a bark. The dog leaped over the bench and stopped, heeding beside her. She squatted and patted the bloody skull of the dog with a smile and a whisper.

The lights went black.

Within the darkness, both of the side doors opened. The Cee team members turned around and moved off the floor and back into the dark room of the Cee team hallway.

The twin Zulu Time hostesses stood inside the archway with a smile, saying in unison. "It is done."

Jackie smiled within the darkness. "Thank you for visiting Zulu Time. I hoped that you have enjoyed the evening program."

Jamie smiled within the darkness. "Good night from Jaime and Jackie Jones until tomorrow night."
280th day of the year

07:07 am (early morning)

Warm temperatures and clear sky of sunshine

House of seventeen-year-old Igala Smith

Breakfast setting

I sat with my family at the breakfast table, eating the morning meal.

The noise sounded with a ding.

I lifted up and tapped the bracelet communication device or com-d on the tiny screen with a smile to see my friend.

Com-d was mobile telephone.

A teen female possessed a head of blonde hair with a set of black, red, and purple dotted colors and a tone of pale skin in the colors of pink, purple, and yellow hues in a set of hollowed out butterfly facial designs, and a mouth of braces for her crooked teeth with a metal smile. _"Igala, can you come...?"_

Her mom turned and frowned at her first born daughter. "Not during our meal time, Igala. You may call Minki back after gathering the dirty dishes into the dishwasher for me. And when are you removing that silly makeup from your face? You will come to the supper table with a clean face, tonight. Do you understand me?"

Every morning and night, the Smith family members sat together at the old model dining table for each meal per her dad's instructions. Since, the life of Igala was busy with school, boys, boys, and boys while her dad's life was filled with job work, yard work, and keeping her away from the cute teen boys.

Her parents enjoyed the social gatherings before their two cute daughters and one mischievous son quickly grew up from a batch of silly kids into a set of careless teens.

I was a seventeen-year-old female and a non-studious academic student at Hall, preparing for my new life, selecting a re-generator job, getting married to some handsome and unknown teen male, and making a happy ending for my person inside Society City Four.

I said with a stern face down to my com-d. "Yes ma'am. Bye, Minki." Minki stuck out a pink colored tongue tip at Igala which was really for the mother of Igala. The bracelet com-d turned back into my cute colorful picture of my person. I reached down and grabbed the fork, scattering the food around the plate, hearing a set of four different musical styles inside the house, which consisted of rock and roll, classical, country, and pop music.

The mom of Igala, Henoana did not mind any noise or mess, because she was a working mother with a metal maid.

The dad of Igala, Genic looked up with a smile to see his daughter with the matching aqua colored eyeballs, holding the fork of food. "And how did the Old Girl do on the road highway yesterday, Igala?"

The nine-year-old mischievous brother of Igala, segue wore a set of green hollow frogs on each cheekbone, turning with a smile and a pair of matching aqua colored eyeballs to see his dad. "The young driver viciously banged head-on into one of six stone pylons inside the parking lot of the Hall while trying to park the Old Girl." He ate and chewed the food with a grin.

I turned and parted my lips at the nose profile of my brother, "Monkey spy, you're a slithering monkey spy, little brother. He used..."

Segue swallowed the food, lifting up and touched the com-d device on his wrist as the painted frogs crocked in a musical tone on each smiling cheekbone. "He used the famous black box. That's really colored in black and secretly hidden underneath the steering column inside the Old Girl. I accessed the video tape on my com-d while watching the bump and grind of a once smooth shiny front metal bumper. The bumper of the Old Girl is made from a piece of delicate silver chrome. Chrome ain't harvested or shaped anymore, since it can be easily damaged against a natural mineral like a vertical slab of bedrock limestone. At the Hall structure, each stone pylon is a tall and rounded shape of gray hard natural limestone, marking the individual parking spot for each Hall fart like..."

Every kid at the age of eight years old owned a communication device or com-d for safety and entertainment. Com-d was the world's communication for voice, music, written, and visual happenings.

In the year 2078, all academic classes occurred within a home family environment under close parental supervision, starting at the age of four. Every household family was provided with a teacher robot from Society for academic lectures, ranging from literature to spelling to science. However, the teacher robot did not wash the supper dishes.

Some households owned robots for housekeeping, babysitting, garden landscaping, and building repairs. The Smith family owned a teacher robot for the students and a housekeeping robot to assist the mom of Igala with the house work, since her granny Oltole was too old for any type of domestic chores.

When a student reached the age of seventeen years old, a training program was offered at the Hall, a place-like classroom for students. The same-age teens trained and tested their intellectual skills for a re-generator paying job within Society City Four.

All the eating utensils dropped down and hit upon the center of each breakfast plate at the same time as all the bodies stood upright from each dining room chair. And then all bodies turned with a worried brow and moved out the front door of the house, stopping inside the private driveway.

Outside, her dad Genic stopped and stood with a sour frown in front of an obvious indentation into the front bumper of the ancient car first, following by her brother, her mother, her grandmother, and her younger sister, in that order, too.

Igala moved and stood behind the back spine of her parents, looking down at the ugly non-polished boot toes with a worried brow.

Genic turned and frowned down at his son. "Son, we do not use that vile language at our dining table or inside our home floor ever. You apologize to your big sister, understand me?"

Segue looked down with a sour frown to see his naked feet. "Yes sir. I'm sorry."

"Apology accepted." I said meekly to my boot toes as I did not tattle tale about a crunched front bumper from parking the Old Girl for the first time at the Hall either.

"Did you sustain any type of body injury, sweetheart?" Genic turned back and frowned at the dent in the chrome as he looked ugly within his fifty plus years with a head of black and gray hair on a tone of pale tinted skin.

My aqua colored eyeballs like my parents continued to stare down at the boot toes. "No," I wore a head of long black hair but the ends of my hair was colored in flaming red, deep purple, candy pink, and sunshine yellow. My natural pale glowing complexion was decorated in an array of blue, green, and pink outlined flying bird designs for fun and rebellion as a teen. As my cheekbones crashed the good food bites, each bird sung a pretty whistling song.

All the young kids and the immature teenagers enjoyed coloring their hair roots and their faces for fun and annoyance of their parents until each one hit the age of adulthood, where the concept of fun was forbidden. The face paint would creak and crack on the smooth skin of the teenage, making a pretty song or a nasty sound as the face paint didn't flake off but disintegrated through the air waves by bed time.

"Did you have any other passengers inside the car, Igala?" Henoana frowned down at the ugly dent within the shiny silver-tinted chrome too as her slightly wrinkled face looked uglier within her fifty plus years with a head of cropped black and gray colored hair with a tone of pale skin, without the re-designed colored makeup. Henoana mom didn't enjoy spending her hard working coins on a cabinet of expensive re-designer makeup or a closet of re-designer clothing for herself or her children. There were too many other important housekeeping expenses, such like, food, warmth, and shelter.

"No," I said meekly to my boot toes as each colorful painted bird softly song a new whistle for my eardrums only, but I bet my mom heard it too.

"Did another student eye witness your crash into the stone pylon, Igala?" Her grandmother, Oltole frowned down at the dent in the chrome too as she looked ugliest within her seventy plus years with a head of cropped short gray colored hair on a pale and wrinkled face of concern, and an old pair of aqua colored eyeballs.

"No," I said to the boot toes as the birds softly song the same whistling song again.

Genic exhaled with a huff of worry. "Igala, it is very important that you always tell one of us about any type of car crash on the Old Girl."

The 'Old Girl' was an ancient Cadillac gasoline-propelled vehicle from an ancient year of 1976, which was last century. The Cadillac was a pretty aquamarine color with a set of two horizontal doors, a convertible top which could be dropped down on any sunny day. The big car held eight wild-ass teens or six mature adults or one responsible driver plus nine silly kids less than eight years old.

At the age of seventeen years old, the Society law granted a teen driver any type of transport with one, two, three, four, or no set of rubber tires.

A hover vehicle flew twenty feet from the hard road pavement or over the smooth dirt soil, running on a combination of solar cells, electricity power, and every day garage from your kitchen trash can.

I passed my cyberspace driving test on a transport robot at the Regulator office, anticipating both a birthday party and a car, since my parents bartered an ancient television for an ancient car.

The ancient Cadillac was not my first choice for a rolling or a hovering cool teen vehicle as my aquamarine irises eyeballed a new sports hover car, a gray sleek-looking semi-rounded mouse-shaped object, costing 50,000 coins.

Coin was money.

A cool hover car sucked up both of its two horizontal platform skis underneath a smooth flat belly of black metal while hovering in the air, instead of using a set of four rubber black tires on the ground. The doors slid vertically up into the sky hitting your nose bridge or bopping a chin on one of the older hover cars, instead of slanting out at a forty-five-degree angle on the ancient rolling car. The latest hover car was invented by a cool and smart re-generator, who re-designed hovering transports with both abused metals and new minerals on planet Earth.

"Yes sir." I meekly said to my boot toes as the red bird whistled again on my right cheekbone.

Henoana leaned over with a sour frown and touched the dent on the ancient car, stood upright with a sour tone. "The front bumper will not be fixed, Igala. This will serve as a reminder of your silly teen carelessness. I cannot emphasize enough for you to pay attention to your exterior surroundings, especially when driving a car or walking down a sideway or riding a bicycle. This new family rule applies to each and every driver of our precious family. Do you understand our new rule?"

I looked up to the skyline and rolled both eyeballs with a sour frown, returning back down to see my boot toes. "You sound like a Regulator, Mom?"

Henoana nodded with a sour frown down to the dent. "Indeed, I do. And you should know too. Since, a Regulator is the only authority to enforce all the rules of Society City Four. And these same rules keep the Society both safe and happy. So, I do not want you to be forgetting this simply life lesson, Igala. You will find out in due time how vitally important a Regulator is in our lives and lifestyle." She turned with a distorted face and a disgusted huff, grabbing and shoved the other two children toward the front door of the house for the daily homework assignments. Henoana stood in place next to Igala, watching the back spines of the Segue and Laddie. "Get inside and get to your homework, Laddie and Segue."

The children turned around and moved ahead toward the open door of the house.

"That's a life lesson for later, Igala," Oltole turned and tapped the collar bone of Igala with a sour frown and a nod, spinning around, moving back into the open front door of the house also to finish her breakfast.

Henoana and Genic, the parents of Igala, Segue, and Laddie worked as a pair of re-generators.

Every working person was a re-generator, who re-shaped or re-designed something, such like, a car, a house, a boat, a building, a piece of dish, a piece of furniture, or a piece of clothing. Or a working parent was a re-merchant, who re-sold and re-designed products for coins. The raw resources of oil, minerals, plants, and animals were actually plentifully abundant on planet Earth. However, the Society had established a new rule that all natural sources were to be re-shaped, re-designed, and re-structured until destroyed, hence the ancient Cadillac.

Henoana reached out and gently shoved Igala toward the car with a sour frown and a nod. "Get moving for Hall, now. You don't wanna be late for you important training re-gen sessions. Have you decided on a re-generator job?"

"Not yet." I stared down at my boot toes with a sour frown as the bird sung another sweet song.

Genic turned with a smile and moved to his wife, cuddling her body and her angry. He gently shoved them forward, strolling back into the house with the open door. He yelled with a grin. "Have a good day at Hall, Igala."

They disappeared into the house.

The front door closed.

The car door opened.

"Thanks." I slid into the driver's seat with a stern face and a sigh of relief for my minor punishment, touching and starting the old key style engine. The car door closed. I drove ahead, traveling down the private driveway and moved onto an empty city street without another ancient car to Hall, since every other adult and teen flew twenty feet above the Old Girl inside a cool-looking hover vehicle.

Hall building

08:08 am (early morning)

Warm temperatures and partly cloudy with sunshine

Parking lot setting

I parked the ancient car underneath the row of tall trees for shade, scooting out the door for my class training, moving alone toward the open archway of the three story building as the other hover transports halted and settled over the pavement, ejecting an assortment of students for class too.

Outside in the sunshine in front of the Hall building, Ucal moved away from his hover car and swung around with a fast fist action at his best friend Dfee, missing for fun and entertainment, saying with a laugh and a smile, "Pow! The fist landed on the male's jaw line. And then the wussie went down hard into the dirt, not dead. And then that girl with a construction hammer slammed his skull..." He pulled up beside Dfee, moving with a smile toward the front of the building.

"Shh." Dfee turned with a sour frown and a whisper to see the other teens. "It's against the Society rules to openly talk about the Bowl activities from last night." He turned back with a sour frown to see the nose profile of Ucal. "I do believe that you know that too. Are you looking to get us into trouble with a Regulator present inside our classroom today? Then you will be going to..."

"Naw," Ucal moved ahead toward the front door of the re-structured Hall building with a grin and a whisper. "And saying the word Regulator present in mixed company is against the Society rules too. And none are present at Hall, ever. Stay cool. You're my best pal. We're just sharing some slimy secrets for fun."

"Hey, Ucal," A soprano voice of the teen female yelled as her body bumped into his back spine from behind with a giggle. She scooted by him and spun around with a smile and a wink to face Ucal and slowly walked backward, wearing a set of re-designer blue and pink colored sandal heels and a pair of re-designer pants with a matching re-designer blue and pink silk blouse. Her com-d was worn on her wrist. Her face was decorated in a series of tiny four-leaf cloves of various colors of green, red, orange, yellow, and blue, singing a sweet hum into her eardrums only. She possessed a head of brown colored hair, a tone of dark tinted skin, and a pair of brown eyeballs. Her hair was colored in circle designs of green, red, orange, yellow, and blue to match her facial designs.

He smiled with a wink and a nod to the teen girl. "Eimeria, gorgeous, you are looking very beautiful this sunshine morning in your pretty colored cloves," Ucal was a tall teen male with a head of shoulder length strawberry blonde colored hair, a face of red dusted whiskers, a pair of blue eyeballs, and a tone of pale tinted skin, without any type of makeup facial decoration, and a pair of rippled muscles, wearing a re-designer black T-shirt with a pair of ripped and faded re-designer blue jeans. And his favorite pair of cowboy boots of aquamarine and black polished colors.

Eimeria spun around without missing a beat with a smile, moving ahead with a hum into the classroom style setting.

"Is she the one?" Dfee leaned over and elbowed his best pal with a snort and a grin.

"No, Eimeria is not the one." Ucal shook his curls with a smile.

"Who is the one?" He gasped.

"I haven't decided. Have you decided?"

Dfee nodded with a grin. "Yeah, I've decided."

Ucal turned with a gasp and a whisper to see the nose profile of Dfee. "Who? Who's the one that you wanna marry next year as your wife?"

"I don't twaddle and wattle to just anyone." He climbed the stairs with a laugh and a grin of mischievousness.

On the front entrance porch setting, both of the doors were opened inside the double archway.

A middle aged male stood beside the doorway with a set of twin bald spots over each eyebrow and a pot belly of good food around a thick middle, pointing with a sour frown and a matching tone down at the darken hallway. "Good morning, teens. Move down the hallway toward the memorial wall for the morning assignment as always. Please pick a work station and a partner as always. We have numerous memorials to draw today as always."

"Ah, naw! Tell me it ain't so? Mr. Twaddle, the waddle is here to save the day. Hurray!" Dfee moved ahead through the archway with a chuckle and a smile as a tall teen male with head of shoulder length dark brown hair, a tone of yellow tinted skin, a pair of light mint green eyeballs, a face of brown dusted whiskers, and a pair of rippled muscles, wearing a pair of ripped and faded non-re-designer blue jeans, a dark blue colored non-re-designer T-shirt, and a pair of polished cowboy boots of brown and black.

Twaddle was abused and used to the childish sarcasm from each teen that he had taught at Hall, his selected re-generator job to re-teach an arrogant teen for a good paying job within Society City Four. He nodded with a smile to each abusive teenager without backlash, since he could not accuse the teenage of a ping of verbal abuse. However, he did experience mental abuse every day which would land him and the selected teen inside Zulu Time, one day.

He turned away from the archway and followed the last two back spines of each teen down a long darken breezeway which was covered with a tent and a set of naked and beaten up tall wooden tables and matching tall chairs. He stopped and stood in the middle of the open space in front of the naked concrete wall with a stern face and a serious tone to each teen. "Find a work station and a partner. We have lots to do today. The lecture for today is the topic of a sport. A sport is defined as all forms of competitive physical activity of either a casual or an organized participation. A sport provides the opportunity to nurture both physical skills and social interaction skills. And finally, a sport is based on physical dexterity of competition without subjective or objective measures. The measurement in the class today will be with crayons, an artistic impression.

"Teens, you are viewing behind my skull a wall of wattle and daub. The wooden strips are called wattle. The wattle is daubed with a wet sticky material of clay and sand. And the wet sticky material is colored for fun for the silly teens today. This is part of your memorial for all the dead criminals from Zulu Time, last night. Wattle and daub has been used for at least 6,000 years in building construction."

Seventeen-year-old teen male Keer stood near a selected tall table with a face of red whiskers and a head of matching shoulder length blonde hair, a pair of faded and ripped re-designer blue colored trousers, a re-designer red dress shirt, and a pair of blue re-designer shoes, looking down with a smile and a nod to see his com-d, texting a message to his mother. "We know and do this now, yesterday, last yesterday, the day before yesterday, and the other day before yesterday."

Twaddle said with a stern face and a flat tone to each teen. "The Wall of Memory curves forming two connected wall. On each wall, there is a set of dark maple wooden frames making up a perfect square or a tall triangle or a long rectangular geometric shape. Within each wooden frame, I will repeat for all wax clogged eardrums. Within each wooden frame, the concrete is moist and colored for witty fun like a child's crayon.

"You will wear an ugly protective old stinky non-re-designer jumpsuit with an attached old and stinky non-re-designer hoodie over all your re-designer clothing, including your re-designer shoes and your hair-sprayed multi-colored ponytails. And don't bitch to me, if you get crayon colors on your new re-designer outfit, since the crayon mixture is chemically attracted to the old and ancient horse-haired jumpsuit. The crayon colors should not adhere to you or your hair, unless you place it there for annoyingly fun. And there it should remain until you receive from me the anti-color serum for being an amusingly annoyant. Now, go ahead and be creative. Since today, everyone will receive the letter grade 'A' in your physical sport session which is required before you graduate from Hall and select a re-generator job."

All the teens stood upright from the chair and scooted around the designated work space, claiming a particular wattle and daub geometric figure on one of the two walls of memory.

I stood upright and swung around, marching toward the clothing tub, stopping, stood in front the tub, reaching out, grabbing and cuddled the top jumpsuit into both breasts and swung around into a wall of muscle with a gasp.

Ucal reached out and grabbed, holding both biceps with a grin and a chuckle. "I caught you, gorgeous. You stole my property. So, I guess that means you are my property, too," chuckling.

I looked up with a smirk to see his cute face of red whiskers, his bouncing shoulder length strawberry blonde locks, and his happy grin. "I've not stolen your personal property, boy. And I ain't your personal property, either." I looked down with a smile to the floor and up to see his grin. "But I might trade you some of my personal property for your brightly polished boots of aqua and black. Are these girly boots, Ucal?"

He chuckled. "No, gorgeous! But I do match your girly aquamarine colored pretty car. That's an old Cad with a set of four ancient rubber tires for running over the soft dirt and the soft grass and the hard pavement, but you can be run over me with your softness and your hardness anywhere, anytime, and everywhere," winking.

I smiled. "Yeah, my dad wanted his first born to arrive home safe and sound in monster ugly style."

He leaned over with a smile into her grin. "The rear back bench is about sixty-five inches long. You should fit perfectly in a horizontal pose over the soft leather of the rear bench."

I parted my lips with a grin. "Smarthole, I'm five feet and nine inches. That's sixty-nine inches, four inches less. That makes me too short for the rear back horizontal bench seating."

"Then we fold our long legs around each other," Ucal chuckled and continued to block Igala's female friend Minki from the tub of clothing, on purpose.

Minki bumped into the rear blue jeans of Ucal on purpose, too, scooting around and standing between the clothing tub and the nose profile of Igala with a grin and a giggle. "Hello there, I'm Minki."

"Know ya." Tall Ucal reached around petite Minki, who possessed a head of long blonde with ugly makeup colors, a tone of pale skin with uglier makeup colors, and a pair of gray eyes as he snatched a jumpsuit from the tub, swinging away from her and Igala with a sour frown and a nasty huff of annoyance.

Minki popped the green colored bubble gum with a set of rude manners and a soft hum. She was the girl pal of Igala from their shared on-line educational sessions since the age of five years old. Minki lived in the eastern city blocks of Society City Four. Igala resided in the western rural countryside. The farm of Minki's paternal grandfather was three miles from Igala, but Minki never visited with her grandfather or the smelly horses.

I caressed the jumpsuit with a giggle of the innocent flirtation, staring at the back spine of cute teen-hunk Ucal. This was my second day of Hall which was a training session for a permanent paying re-generator job at the age of eighteen years old. The Hall was also a meeting place for recreational fun activities, such-like, weddings, preachings, teachings, and general entertainment events.

Minki chewed the green colored gum with a set of crooked teeth within the metal braces, blocking the clothing tub from the other teens, staring at the rear blue jeans of Ucal with a puzzled brow. "How do you know cutie teen-hunk Ucal?"

I grabbed another jumpsuit from the tub and shoved Minki on the collar bone away from the clothing tub, moving ahead and stop, standing at the selected work station in front of an orange colored wattle and daub with a smile. "His grandmother and my grandmother lived next door to each other for eons, before both their life forms terminated. Her house was sold to strangers. And I was not invited over to see his grandmother anymore." I dressed in the stinky jumpsuit over my non-re-designer clothing.

Minki turned to the second wall without dressing in the jumpsuit and popped the gum, spying on the rear blue jeans of Ucal with a grin and a nod. "So you played house with Ucal?"

I zipped the jumpsuit up and over my hand-me-down T-shirt and a pair of ripped and faded blue jeans from my mother, since I was almost adult and her same height and measurements. "No. We played on horses back behind the barn in the cow pasture, racing to the pond, fishing for crappies. I'm a country princess. His family lives somewhere inside the southern part of City Four which is far away from our residential houses." I covered my funky colored hair with the stinky old hoodie, staring with a smile at the orange crayon colored wattle and daub.

Minki still spied on the rear blue jeans of Ucal. All the other students stood or sat at a work station, facing a wattle and daub structure for the morning assignment.

I selected an upside down triangle, not for any particular reason. But I did like the color orange.

Minki stood in place and stared on the boy-pair of Ucal and Dfee. Ucal and Dfee were good friends and neighbor-boys, who stared at a honey-golden colored wattle and daub square. She turned with a sour frown and blinked a set of fake re-designer eyelashes, staring at the orange wet color. "Why did pick this waddle?"

I turned with a smile to see my other female girl pals Lexedo and Kallidin, who were working on a white wattle and daub square. I returned the smile to see the orange triangle, "Wattle."

Minki looked up and down with a sour frown to see full length of the geometric slot with a gasp. "It's taller than me."

I looked down and kicked the object with a giggle and a nod. "Step ladder, girl pal. What shall we create?" I returned back to the orange triangle with a smile.

She sneered at the orange triangle. "I don't care. We get an automatic grade letter 'A.' Do something easy!"

Twaddle moved back and forth the concrete colored wall with a stern face and a serious tone behind the back spines of each teen, "The colors range in various tones. Puke green. Candy pink. Ocean golden sand. Orange. Yellow. Baby blue. Lavender. Coral pink. Lemon yellow. No black. No white. No gray. And this is for fun. You will utilize a paint foil, not a paint brush. It is similar to a cookie cutter. The cookies are located on the long table without food against the rear tent curtain. There is no need for a drop cloth to capture wet colored paint or masking tape to cover your neighbor's wall."

Lexedo stared at her wattle and daub. "Can I chew my gum?"

Twaddle moved back and forth behind the back spines of each teen with a sour frown and a matching tone. "Yes, Lexedo, you can chew a piece of gum. You can drink a sweet tea. You can smoke a joint. You can drink alcohol. All these things are legal here and everywhere, because any individual can do anything, as long as, you don't end up in Zulu Time," chuckling.

Minki swayed side to side in a pair of re-designer heels with a sour frown and a matching tone at the orange triangle. "Is he going to sputter like my great-grandfather's old gasoline car the entire time during Hall?"

I spun around away from the wall with a smile and moved ahead toward the cookie cutter tray for my selection, "Yeah."

Minki swung around from the wall with a smile and pulled up beside Igala, turning to stare at the rear blue jeans of Ucal and Dfee, again. "Is Dfee going to spy on me during our Hall time, too?"

I stopped at the cookie tray and picked through the different silver tinted cookie cutters for our daily memorial job. "No."

She stopped beside Igala with a smile and a nod, staring the blue jeans of the two cutie males. "Yeah, he's looking right at me."

I turned with a puzzled brow to see both of the back spines of Ucal and Dfee, who were working and head butting on their particularly wall. "No." I returned my eyeballs back to the cookie cutter tray.

Twaddle stopped in the middle of the breezeway, pointing to the cookie cutter tray with a stern face and a serious tone. "Flowers, dinosaurs, dogs, kittens, animals, fruits, vegetables, gingerbread, Christmas trees, birds, bugs, spiders, snakes, guitars, pianos, musical instruments, fighter jets to airplanes, boats, and cars from a fast sports car to the old fashioned Model-T Ford to the new model flying hover car. That I don't own, but wish I could. There is a western cowboy theme with horses, cows, buffalo, saddles, cacti. We have wedding theme with a bride..."

"Aw..." sung the teen females in unison with a set of giggles and smiles.

"Nu..." chanted the teen males in unison with a set of laughs and boos.

Twaddle smiled. "And a groom comes with a church steeple and a wedding cake."

At 09:09 am (mid-morning), Twaddle moved around the room, venturing to each wattle and daub for inspection and approval, standing in front of the wattle and daub of Ucal and Dfee with a smile and a nod. "Ah. A summer time theme, this is very refreshing. I see a set of four conch seashells around the wattle square-shaped, a set of eight girly bikini tops, without the girly bikini bottoms. And there are six pairs of flip flops. I see a set of four bikini tops which is paired with a single pair of flip flops. That represents four..."

"Bathing beauties," Dfee elbowed with a chuckle and a grin into the bicep of Ucal as Ucal elbowed back with a nod and chuckle too.

Twaddle frowned at the wattle and daub, "There are eight girls on your wattle and daub. Is that a symbol of fruit, a cherry with three leaves?"

Ucal chuckled with a nod, "Four cherries each, sir."

"I like cherries." Twaddle smiled with a nod to the wattle and daub.

"We like to pop the cherries, sir." Ucal elbowed with a chuckle and a grin into the bicep of Dfee.

Twaddle frowned. "Gentlemen, where are the two guys?"

Dfee smiled. "Here."

Ucal smiled. "Here."

Twaddle lifted up and pressed a starfish cookie cutter into the wet mixture with a sour frown and a matching tone. "You pass, barely, boys."

Dfee chuckled. "Thanks, Mr. Twaddle, the waddle."

He whispered for his eardrums only. "One day..." Twaddle side stepped to the next wattle and daub of Lexedo and Kallidin with a smile and a nod. "A white wedding gown, a red heart, a yellow-tinted church with a tall steeple, a silver wedding ring, a white angel, a black bowtie, the groom, and a lavender three-tier wedding cake. Lovely, you both receive a star, too." He lifted up and stamped the starfish cutter beside the wedding cake in lavender.

Twaddle side stepped and viewed the wattle and daub of Igala and Minki. Minki stared at the rear blue jeans of both Ucal and Dfee. He frowned with confusion at the wall, "A snake..."

I smiled with a nod as the colorful birds tooted a soft sing on both cheekbones. "The symbol is a king cobra snake."

Twaddle frowned. "The brown and tan snake looks dead to me."

I shook my curls with a grin as my birds tooted another soft sing. "No sir. The snake is in its final last stage of dying from a vicious insect attack."

He frowned at the wattle and daub art work. "You have a swarm of black and yellow bumblebees, a nest of black widow spiders, an army red crawling ants, and a flock of blue and green cute butterflies. Butterflies do not ever attack a snake. This art work is for the deceased family members to view as a reminder of their precious happy lives, not depressing souls in hell. We don't wanna scare them to death, Igala. You pass with a letter grade B, better work on it later, tomorrow. And you, two must finish some of the incomplete mathematical problems from last year, also, before you can graduate Hall at the age of eighteen years old." He back stepped from the wall and spun around in front of Igala with a sour frown, moving ahead toward the open archway of the building, leading all the teens down the darken hallway back into the classroom with a sour tone. "We have finished the memorials for the morning time. Please follow me into the classroom for the daily lecture."

I softly clapped with a grin at the wattle and daub art work as my birds tooted a third soft song.

Minki turned with a sneer to see the nose profile of Igala as her project was incomplete for the day and would need more work tomorrow along with the overdue mathematical assignments that interfered with her social life as a teen.

At 10:10 am (late morning) inside the interior classroom, I swung around from the wall and followed behind the butthole of my peers with a grin and a hum into the enclosed classroom, selecting and sitting at one of the high tables near the dull and plain beige colored wall. The Hall did not display a set of long and wide outside windows, since decades ago researchers had learned that a teenager learned better without the distraction of tall trees, blue skies, and wildlife birds. But I didn't believe that the researchers took into consideration the other wildlife, cute teen-hunk males.

Minki moved ahead and stopped, sitting with her girl pal Igala like always at the shared table, staring at the two adult females in front of the classroom with a stern face in silence.

The rest of the class quietly sat and stared at the two adult females as well.

The two adult females were a set of twins, sitting behind an empty long table in front of the plain dull beige wall. The female on the right wore a silver tinted one-piece jumpsuit with a painted face of red, gray, black, and yellow rose designs and a smile. The other female displayed a mauve and blue one-piece jumpsuit with a painted face of hollowed diamond formations of green, brown, blue, and pink colors.

The female on the right smiled with a nod, cupping both hands on top of the empty table surface. "Good morning, teens. I am Jackie Jones. I understand this is your second day at Hall. I am very pleased to be present today. On the first week of Hall, we come here and talk with you about your short life as a seventeen-year-old individual. Everyone inside Hall turned seventeen about a month or so ago. Therefore, this is one reason for our personal face-to-face visit. You live in a numbered Society City with your biological parents and your extended family members, maybe. Your parents provide for you throughout the next coming year until you decide to learn a trade in Hall, then you will take on a re-gen job to become a productive and active individual for the resting days of our elderly life, since the life expectation is over hundred years of age."

The second female on the left smiled with a nod with a set of cupped hands on the same table. "Good morning, teens. I am Jaime Jones. Our long life comes from a historical fact that our great Society has no crime and no corruption, anymore. There are no boarded up house structures with diseased rats and smelly homeless bums. Marijuana is legal. Alcohol is legal. Cigarettes are legal. And we like being in touch, connected socially like a litter of furry kittens. This is the definition of Society. However, our Society has rules for all the social beings living within our Society. Some of the legal rules, such like, stolen information, stolen coins, stolen property, and a stolen life are against Society, making the person a criminal of the law."

Jackie smiled. "In the year 2024, a human body could be cut, scraped, sculptured, remodeled and even lengthened for a healthy improvement. However, crime and violence was increasing at a fearful rate for non-improvement, because billions of people did not possess an ounce of respect for the law or the lawman, thus the Society lived in fear, coming from the lack of legal authority. This was our Society back then."

Jaime smiled with a nod. "In the historical past, the legal jurisdiction over a civil or a criminal lawsuit was a long and lengthy process for a lawyer, by a lawyer, and from a lawyer. Law and lawyers regulated the litigation in every single corner city hall, making our Society both corrupt and wicked. Theft was not really punished. Cheating on an academic test in both high school and college was not really punished. And murderers were not punished for the criminal but paid dearly by the victims."

Jackie smiled with a nod. "The birth of the Regulator in the year 2030 was created by all the citizens, who had collected and gathered all the crooked and corrupt representatives of the people. The Regulator trialed and found them guilty of confiscating and stealing land property and possessions of the people. Each representative of the people and their immediate family members tried to negotiate, money bribe, or threatened to kill the Regulator to save their assets. However, the Regulator ruled that a citizen could not be denied right to their personal property, such as, the land, the car, the food, the clothes, the house, the pets, and the coins. So when a citizen is guilty of a theft, then the citizen is sentenced into Zulu Time. Inside the enclosed building of Zulu Time, if the guilty citizen wins the justification fight which is judged by all the other citizens, then the guilty citizen is free of the crime of theft."

Jaime smiled with a nod. "Let me illustrate with a simple old fashioned example from our historical books. The Cee team member is a local re-merchant, a tire car company. Mrs. Jones is the victim or a part of the Vee team member. Her car pops a tire and rolls down into a deep dirt ditch, damaging her personal car. Therefore, the victim or the Vee team seeks a fair just and justice decision for filing a criminal claim with the Regulator. The Regulator accepts the claim always. Then the family unit of the Cee team receives a visit from the Regulator for an invite into Zulu Time. Each team has twenty seconds to debate their justification case to the watching viewers, living within the Society City Four. The citizens of Society City Four vote by com-d on a winner of the legal battle, so to speak. And the winner wins. The loser loses. And then the winner receives all the assets of the loser, including the property land, the residential homestead, the re-designer furniture, the vehicles, the com-d devices, the re-built appliances, the re-designer clothing, and all the coins."

Jackie smiled with a nod. "Society learns and breathes the practice of honesty. Once Zulu Time was properly placed and established, it absolutely cleaned up our Society from dishonest towards honest. This is the purpose of Zulu Time. This is the reason for Zulu Time. This is Zulu Time. Are there any questions and nice comments for us, today, young seventeen-year-old students?"

Both the adult females stood upright from the chairs with a stern face and a serious tone to see each teen face inside the Hall room, saying in unison. "Life is hard. But death is the hardest thing of all to comprehend. Good day, teens." They back stepped and scooted away from the table, moving ahead to the rear wall of the closed door.

One of the male teens stood upright from the chair and dashed to the side, opening the door for the twin females of Zulu Time with a smile and a nod in silence.

The females moved forward and left the Hall building.

The classroom door closed. The male teen returned to the table with a smile.

Twaddle sat inside a wall office desk with a sour frown to see each teen face. "Some of you own me homework assignments. Please turn the electronic files into me, this week. Hall is dismissed for the afternoon. See every seventeen-year-old, tomorrow."

11:11 am (late morning)

Hot temperatures and clear sky of sunshine

Hall parking lot setting

There was not any type of whistle or bell that ended all the academic classes at Hall.

Each teen slowly stood upright from the table and left the Hall building through the front entrance doors, slowly shuffling down into a personal transport for the end of the session.

I stood upright from the table and turned from the chair, marching behind the back spine of my girl pal Minki through the archway into the bright sunshine for an early day of Hall. I veered to the side portion of the parking lot for my parked car. The ancient car was so big that I had to park near a row of tall over story trees and a low bed of pretty wildflowers. I moved ahead with a smile and a hum and stopped, standing in front of the driver's door. The door opened with a soft creak. I slid inside the smooth leather and reached over, pressing the button on the dash console. The white colored original cow leather convertible top shifted up and then dropped down into a wide slot, revealing a pretty of sunshine and fresh air inside the cockpit of the Old Girl. I would have a nice trip back home after the depressing Zulu Time stuff as my eardrums heard the giggles but my mind wandered about cute teen-hunk Ucal. I slid out and stood near the driver's seat, watching the rooftop slid down and disappear into the trunk space with a grin and a giggle, clapping with excitement of a new teen driver.

Lexedo was a short and skinny girl with a head of short brown pixie hair, a tone of bronze skin, and a pair of aqua colored eyeballs, dashing away from the building and followed behind the back spine of her girl pal Igala, climbing through the open driver's door and into the rear back seat of the ancient car. She was scooting to the end of the car and slid down into the smooth leather, sitting over the long bench seat, typing on her com-d for the car's information with a smile and a giggle. "There're sixty-four inches of front shoulder room and sixty-three inches of rear shoulder room."

Kallidin was a tall female teen with a head of long red colored hair, a tone of bronzed tinted skin, and a pair of violet eyes, running and followed behind the butthole of Lexedo, sliding through the open driver's door, sitting inside the rear seat of the ancient car with a confused brow beside her friend Lexedo. "What does that mean?"

Minki stood by the passenger door with a smile and a nod, staring at Igala. "That Igala can drive all of us back home from Hall, right now." She reached out and lifted the door handle. The door opened with a soft creak. Minki slid over the soft leather of the front passenger seat with a grin and a giggle, tapping on both kneecaps with excitement, popping the gum with an upcoming fun ride over the hard pavement, instead of in the sky.

Lexedo turned and grinned at the nose profile of Minki, "Really, all of us?" She turned back and smiled to Igala. "Really, can Igala drive all of us back home from Hall, today?"

"Yeah, all of us to our homes, today," Minki reached over with a fake re-designer red colored fingernail and touched all the pretty shiny buttons on the console with a grin and a giggle.

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance and turned to the side, slowly scooting around the front of my car with a smile, pointing out all the cute features, shaking my curls. "No. But my car has a V-shaped grill with an egg crate style thing which is protected by a set of massive vertical guards that frames a rectangular license plate indentation. The license plate in the front bumper reads: Igala." I spun around with a smile and slid back into the driver's seat, starting the gasoline engine with a smile and a nod, pointing to all the mechanics on the dashboard of my ancient car with the door still open. "It has windshield wipers." I reached over and pressed the windshield wipers button. A set of two individual windshield wipers lifted up and swished the blades side to side over the glass with a soft squeaky sound. I pointed at the wipers with a grin. "Today, a bubble-top on the new hover car doesn't use a pair of windshield wipers but allows the air to rush the rain away from the smooth glass. And all four tires are black colored with a white circle in the center."

Lexedo smiled with a nod at the swishing and soft squeaky windshield wipers. "Cute."

"Classy." Kallidin nodded with a grin at the swishing and soft squeaky windshield wipers too.

"Sassy." Minki grinned at the swishing and soft squeaky wipers, reaching over, dropping a fake fingernail over more of the shiny buttons.

I cut off the engine, because I could not ride any of my friends inside my car per my mom's commands. "All me," I slapped a chest with a giggle and a grin. "The headlights are square shaped too."

Minki turned and smiled at the nose profile of Igala. "Do the front headlights really work for night time driving?"

I shook my curls. "No, I'm not allowed any nighttime driving. And no, I'm not allowed to drive anyone home. And no, the tiny bulb inside the little plastic squares was discounted in the year of something."

Lexedo turned and touched the window glass in the back seat with a pair of dirty fingerprints and a smile. "The side glass windows are big and long."

I smiled with a nod and pointed at each window. "The windows are called coach style like a royal princess in the old foreign country of last century. The princess rode from the castle to see her prince at the palace in a wheeled coach like this one. I learned that from my com-d last night." I reached over and grabbed the door handle. The front driver's door closed with a soft creak.

"Look up, Igala." Lexedo pointed at the front of the engine hood with a grin.

Kallidin looked up with a puzzled brow to the engine hood. "Look up for what?"

Lexedo grinned. "You got an old fashioned hood ornament, an animal of something type."

Minki turned with a puzzled brow and stared the hood ornament, "No, it is a medal of some type. Did this old car fight in battle during the 2020 Rebellion here in Society City Four?"

"I don't think so." I turned and smiled at each girl pal. "Look, I cannot drive all of you home from Hall..."

"Yeah, you can." Minki turned and smiled at the nose profile of Igala.

I shook my curls, banging both palms on the smooth oversized steering column for annoyance. "No, I cannot. The vinyl top is made from the animal called cow plus all the seat leather."

"O, la, la." Lexedo bounced up and down inside the rear seat, sliding side to side into Kallidin for annoyance and fun.

"Come on, Igala." Minki reached and slapped the arm of Igala with a sour pout.

"No, I will not." I shook my curls with a worried brow.

Minki reached over with a smile and grabbed the door handle with a nod. The door closed with a soft creak. "Drive us around the block in your old car then. That ain't the..."

"No," I lifted up and slammed back down both sweaty palms over the steering wheel with a nervous voice. "No, I'm not allowed to drive my friends, anywhere."

"Come on, Igala." Lexedo stood upright on top of the rear seat cushion of the car, pointing ahead to the ground roadway with a smile and a nod. "Lookie, there is a mile of flat road in front of Hall, because the ancient cars used to run around in front of the building for the dorky kids."

Kallidin stood upright on top of the rear seat cushion next to Lexedo with a smile and a nod, waving both her arms and her curls of red color. "Yeah, go around the circle for fun..."

"No, I can't. When you get out of the car, you can see that the pair of rear taillights is molded into sharp cute points like the bottom of an ice cream cone." I smiled.

"Yeah, you can." Lexedo bounced up and down on top of the rear seat inside the car with a smile and a nod, waving both arms at the flat roadway in front of Hall.

"I can drive. I got my transport license to drive around the flat road too." Minki smiled with a nod.

"No." I reached and touched the key chain, sliding my fingers toward the ignition switch and turned it. The engine roared and then purred with power. "Do you hear the power of the engine?"

Minki slapped the naked arm of Igala with a smile and a nod. "Move forward, Igala. I wanna feel the power of the engine under my a..."

"Ask nicely, Minki? Please, Igala." Lexedo dropped down and bounced on top of the rear seating, pointing at the road with a giggle and a grin.

"No." I frowned with frustration, staring ahead at the empty parking lot that led to the flat roadway.

Minki exhaled with a puff of annoyance. "Go around the circle, one time. That's all. We all wanna go home for early am session from Hall, too."

"One time, really slow," Lexedo dropped down and sat inside the rear seating with a nod and a smile.

"Yeah, one time really slow, Igala," Kallidin smiled.

"One time." Minki nodded with a smile.

"Okay, one time." I jerked the gear into drive, without pressing the gasoline pedal. The car moved forward under its own with a set of powerful roaring engines. I lifted both hands from the steering wheel, feeling the movement with a smile. "The car is haunted by she-ghosts. See no hands, Henoana!" I giggled.

Kallidin yelled. "Go faster. This is too slow."

"Press the thing to go." Lexedo yelled.

"A foot pedal." Minki leaned over and pressed the button. And then rock and roll music sounded from the dash and inside the cockpit of the car.

I drove the car with a gasp. "No, no music! My mom said the driver is in charge of the car." I reached over and hit the button off, hearing the gasps of my girl pals, gently tapping the gasoline pedal. The car jumped into fast motion.

"Wee..." Kallidin screamed with a giggle, tossing both arms over her red colored hair roots.

"Fun, whoo-woo." Lexedo yelled with a giggle, lifting both arms over her brown colored hair roots too.

"Go faster, Igala." Minki shouted with a giggle. "Press the foot pedal down to the floor..."

I gently tapped the pedal again with a smile. The car sailed around the curved turn. I placed both cupped hands over the steering wheel, turning it into the circle, keeping the car on the flat roadway with a smile.

"Wee..." Kallidin screamed with a giggle, waving both arms over her red colored hair roots.

"Yay..." Lexedo shouted with a giggle, waving both arms over her brown colored hair roots also.

I turned the curve, pressing the pedal as the car sped around the circle in front of the roadway.

Minki reached out and pressed a new button.

Water soared into the air, sprayed, and hit the front windshield and the hair roots of Lexedo and Kallidin.

Lexedo screamed. "Wet, water, I'm wet. Stop it!"

Kallidin laughed. "Yay, it came from the car. It likes you, girl pal."

I removed both hands, reaching over, touching, searching the console for the correct button. The windshield wipers lifted up and swished side to side with a soft squeaky sound, cleaning and clearing the water and dirt. I could see much better too.

Minki laughed. "Faster." She leaned over and pressed the radio button again. The music played louder. She snapped all her fingers and danced side to side inside the front passenger side of the car.

I reached over and slapped the button with a sour frown and a matching tone. "Stop it, Minki! No music. My mom says that the driver needs to concentrate and not singing the words of the music."

Minki sneered. "Your mom's a wussie." She reached over and pressed a second button. "Watch this!" A large spray of blue colored water injected and covered the entire front windshield.

"Awe, cute." Kallidin giggled with a nod.

"Do it, again?" Lexedo smiled with a nod.

I gasped in terror of blue colored blindness, coming from the blue colored water, and slowly followed the natural curve of the road for a second time, without touching the gasoline pedal for more speed. The ancient car glided over the rough pavement without hesitation.

Minki reached over and hit several buttons with a laugh and a grin. The radio blasted again. The blue colored water sprayed again over the front windshield, covering the glass too.

The car slowed and coasted over the rough road. I released the steering wheel again and reached over, touching all the buttons on the console with a sour frown and a matching tone. "Where's the button for the windshield wipers, Minki? I can find it. I can't see out the window. I see blue..."

"Watch it." Lexedo pointed at the windshield with a smile and a chuckle.

"What?" Kallidin laughed.

All the dropped windows rose up into the air and locked in place.

"Watch it." Lexedo turned and pointed out the window with a giggle and a grin.

"What?" Kallidin laughed.

The roof top lifted up, coming out from the rear truck, blocking out the sunshine, covering the hair roots of the girls.

"Watch it." Lexedo pointed at the rooftop with a smile.

"What?" Kallidin laughed.

"Watch out." Minki pointed at the windshield with a worried brow.

"What?" Kallidin laughed.

I felt a soft thump, slamming down onto the car brakes. The car stopped immediately. I pressed the button for the windshield wipers, clearing the glass, viewing an object with a gasp and a puzzled brow. A grounded hover car was parked ahead of the ancient car without moving forward.

"You hit it, Igala." Minki laughed.

A new hover car slowed and landed behind the ancient car of Igala.

I gasped. "No, it was an accident. The car hit it, not me." I sneered and stared at the red lighted taillights of the hover car, without any damage.

The hover car door lifted up. Ucal exited from his personal hover car and stood upright over the road pavement, turning away from his personal car and moved ahead, stopping, standing at the clear glass window of the Cadillac. He reached down and rapped on the glass as he turned and stared at the other driver inside the other hover car. Igala reached and cranked down the manual window with a rolling feature with a worried brow. He turned back and smiled down to her frown, "Dang, gorgeous, what happened here, Igala?"

"I..." turned with a puzzled brow to stare at cute teen-hunk Ucal near the window and returned a confused brow to see the hover car in front of the bumper of my ancient car.

Ucal turned away from Igala and strutted to the front bumper of her ancient car, looking down with a worried brow at the damage of crushed silver, back stepping and returned back to Igala inside the driver's seat with a smile and a nod. "The Cadillac feature has a front grille and bumper assembly which is placed higher up in the front-end design like a pair of bumper guards. Get it? Guardians of the bumps," chuckling.

"I..." turned and stared with a puzzled brow ahead at the parked hover car.

"What's this?" Minki looked down and touched a yellow cloth over her body, wiping off the dust of the yellow mist with a cough and a sour frown.

Ucal leaned down into the window and looked at the new object that covered the re-designer clothes of Minki with a laugh and a grin. "It is called an airbag cloth to protect your ugly face, Minki. Get out and shake out that white powder from your ugly body, before you ruin the leather car seats, girl."

Minki looked down with a sour frown without seeing her feet but wiggled the shoes with the yellow dust. "No, I got on my new re-designer shoes. I'll get my re-designer skirt dirty, too."

Ucal sneered. "Get out and drag that yellow mess over your ugly face and go back and get to your personal hover car, Minki. I gotta talk to the driver..."

"I should do that." I stared ahead with a worried brow at the hover car in front of the wet windshield of my ancient car and pressed an array of buttons with nervousness. All the windows dropped back down into the slot. Then the rooftop lifted up and descended back down into the trunk space, exposing the bright sunlight on top of the girly hair roots again.

The hover car door slid up into an angle to open without revealing the driver.

Ucal stood upright to see the car door and reached down and touched the arm of Igala with a stern face and a nod. "No. Stay in the car, gorgeous. I'll take care of this for you." He turned away from Igala and moved ahead, stopping, standing in front of the open door of the hover car. Ucal lifted up and tapped on his wrist com-d with a nod and a smile, saying to the face of the driver. "We can settle the car accident matter right here and right now, sir. Okay?" The driver of the hover car nodded in silence inside the driver's seat. Ucal extended an arm into the open door with a grin and his new order. "Type in your coin number on this app and the coins will upload the full amount into your deposit pot." The driver reached out and punched a series of numbers with a grin and a chuckle on the wrist com-d of Ucal. Then the com-d bleeped with the finished coin transaction. Ucal withdrew an arm from the open door with a smile and a nod to the hover driver. "The coin transaction has been completed. Thank you, sir. Have a nice day."

The driver of the hover car nodded in silence, pressing the button. The door slid down shut. Then the parked car floated up from the hard pavement, moving higher into the sky lane of travel and into on-coming hover traffic for the afternoon.

Ucal side stepped from the moving hover car and stopped, standing in front of Igala again with a smile and a nod. "You're cool, gorgeous. This fake roadway incident at Hall did not ever occur, Igala."

I smiled with a wink at Ucal as my protector for the day.

The front passenger door opened with a soft creak.

Minki slid out of the seat with a smirk and turned away from the car door with a giggle, stomping around the front of the car and stopped, standing in front of front bumper with a worried brow. There was an obvious irregular indentation chrome crash which was two inches deep, three inches high, and three inches long from the first day of Hall with her friend Igala. She back stepped from the front bumper with a smile, scooting back around to the passenger door, leaning over the door frame with a grin and a giggle to see the black colored rear hairy skull of Igala. "You can't hide that hole, girl pal. How are you going to explain that dented thing to your mom and dad now?"

"The gray stone slab at the Hall, Genic dearest." Ucal stared down with a laugh and a nod to Igala.

"We all know that she hit that hover car." Minki stood upright with a gasp to see Ucal.

Ucal looked up with a stern face and a serious tone to see Minki. "And we all know that I paid with my coin for the car's damage by my com-d for any future repairs of the metal. This is done and over with, Minki." He reached down and slapped a palm on the soft leather with a smile and a nod. "Good home, Igala. See you in Hall, tomorrow." He back stepped with a smile and swung around with a whistle, moving back toward his 50,000-coin hover car, heading back home, too.

I turned and smiled at his back spine. "Thanks, Ucal. Bye." Then I returned back with a sigh and examined the dashboard for any missing buttons or a hint of interior damage with a worried brow.

Lexedo turned with a smile and a hand wave to see the back spine of Ucal too. "See you later, Ucal."

"Call me, Ucal." Kallidin turned with a smile and a hand wave to see the back spine of the cute teen too. "Ucal, sit with me tomorrow, please."

Minki reached for the door handle with a smile and a nod to see the nose profile of Igala. "Yeah, go on home, Igala." The front passenger door opened again with a soft creak.

Lexedo stood upright and shuffled out from the rear bench of the ancient car with a smile. "No, you should've crushed the entire bumper on the hover car, Igala."

Kallidin stood upright and shuffled out from the rear bench of the ancient car with a grin. "No, you should've concaved the entire rear bench seating."

The front passenger door closed shut with a loud bang. The three girls stood upright and leaned over the open car door frame with a set of silly grins to see the nose profile of Igala.

Minki smiled. "No, you should've jerked your car to the left and then rammed into the driver's door."

Lexedo smiled with a nod. "Yeah, you should've rammed it a second time, killing him."

Minki smirked. "Yeah, then he can't report you, Igala."

I turned with a gasp and a worried brow to see the three girls. "Report me for what, Minki?"

"For anything and everything, Igala," Minki stood upright and spun around from the car and Igala with a smirk, moving ahead to the Hall parking lot to wait for her parents.

Lexedo laughed with a grin. "Minki likes to have sick fun with her ugly lie. So forget her! See you in Hall, tomorrow, Igala." She stood upright and spun around with a giggle and a grin, running after Minki.

Kallidin smiled with a giggle. "Yeah, forget Minki. See you in Hall, tomorrow, too." She stood upright and spun around, running behind the back spines of Minki and Lexedo.

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance, turning away from the back spines of my three girl pals and banged both palms onto the steering column, touching the gasoline pedal and slowly drove ahead over the hard pavement and stopped at the end of the old highway, which was far away from the Hall building and the empty parking lot. I carefully watched for any incoming cars over the flat surface highway and slowly pressed the gasoline pedal. The car slowly steered over rough flat roadway. I slowly drove with a worried brow, feeling the hot exhaust of the flying cars over my hair roots, watching an empty road, heading back home to my house.

07:07 pm (early evening)

Warm temperatures and bright red and pink sunset

House of Igala Smith

Suppertime event

Living room setting

The room was a large space of three solid walls of varied colors with an assortment of older re-designer styles of living room furniture and an eating table with a set of six chairs. The fourth wall space opened up into the kitchen space and a rear patio door that led into a patio space and a flower garden.

One of the walls was composed of a single wall of solid black colored glass without decoration or an illumination of light.

The family sat around the eating table, making lots of noise, lifting and clanking a set of utensils on the empty food plate at suppertime.

Her dad Genic lowered both the fork and the knife inside the empty plate, swallowing the food and clapped with a smile to see each face. "Dinner is done, now. I have a surprise for my family, now."

"What, Dad?" Her five-year-old baby sister Laddie turned and smiled at her father with excitement.

Her nine-year-old brother Segue stood upright from the chair at the dining room table and waved both arms with a smile and a nod to see his dad. "A puppy, you got me a puppy? My birthday's next month. A puppy, where's it at, Dad?" He scooted back from the table and dropped down, sliding underneath the eating table, looking for the puppy with a giggle and a grin of happiness.

"No, son," Genic stood upright with a smile, turning from the dining room table and his family, heading into the living room section of the house.

The living room design possessed a set of three walls. One side wall displayed an array of vertical colors on the wall that held a set of horizontal rows of wooden shelving. The opposite wall exhibited an array of vertical colors that held a set of more horizontal rows of book shelving, too. Between the two side walls, the forward wall inside the living room space showed a solid black colored of glass.

Genic moved ahead with a smile and a nod, patting the object inside the front pocket of his non-designer trousers, heading toward the black colored wall of glass. "Son, please come and help me shuffle the low table lengthwise in front of the long sofa for our special treat tonight. Dear, please bring the dessert tray into the living room for the evening. We will eat our dessert on the low table, tonight." He stopped and stood in low table with a smile, leaning down, sliding and shuffling the low table away from the long sitting sofa for more leg room and numerous buttock seats for the children with the help of his son Segue.

Henoana stood upright from the chair and turned away from the dining room table, moving into the kitchen and assisted the old model housekeeping robot with the tray of dirty dishes with a smile and a nod. "What's your special surprise, honey? Are we having company tonight? Granny only made pie for nine folks. Since, our growing tall boy likes to eat his and three other pie slices."

Genic side stepped away from the low table with a smile and moved ahead, stopping and stood, fiddling with the solid black colored wall of glass. He reached down and removed the object from the front pocket, inserting an individual horizontal glass sharp tip inside a slot portal on the wall of glass. The tip contained the proper electronic access code for the family surprise.

Then the wall of glass changed from rich black into the color of pink then the color of orange, and finally an array of green colorful wiggling horizontal lines behind a solid black colored background.

Henoana turned away from the refrigerator and toted a tray of beverages and dessert dishes into the living room with a smile for the family surprise.

The family house was a one story structure with a set of four tall columns on the front porch. The family inherited the house when the father of Henoana died, giving Igala a separate bedroom when she had shared bedroom with her baby sister Laddie inside the previous house.

When a visitor entered the living space, the visitor moved around the open space, seeing a ten feet sky blue wall, then a ten feet tango orange colored wall, then a ten feet candy pink wall, then a ten feet yellow lemon wall, then a twenty-foot green colored wall which was across a twenty-foot red wall.

Her parents had re-painted the interior walls of the inherited house, since the housekeeping robot performed too many domestic interior of house work and exterior duties, including the yard work.

At five years old, her baby sister Laddie ordered as her birthday present, painting the interior walls with an array of different prism color every ten feet behind the numerous horizontal rows of book shelves. Each book shelf held an assortment of family pictures of alive and dead family members. Therefore, Genic accommodated the wish of Laddie.

However, at ten years old, my birthday wish had been a real riding pony, so I had received a stuffed pony toy in brown hue which was the size of an old fashion clothes washer.

Genic back stepped from the colorful wall of glass with a nod, ensuring the function of the glass tip with a clap and a smile and spun around with a smile, moving ahead to the long sofa, pointing on the sofa and the floor at the seating arrangements. "Okay. Please sit. Henoana sits on the end. Granny gets the middle of the long sofa. My seat is the opposite side. Igala, you seat beside your granny like always. And Segue sits in front of me. Laddie sits in front of her mother. Everyone assume your position." He stopped and stood, swinging around to the sofa and sat with a grin.

Henoana stopped and stood in front of the low table, leaning down with a smile, sitting the tray of dessert on top of the low table and then handed the dessert plates with a smile. "Dear, you're being very mysterious. And why is the glass wall showing a wiggling green line of nothing?"

"That's my surprise," Genic reached down and grabbed a plate of pie with a smile. "Hurry! Hurry! Everyone, come and take their position. The program will be starting soon." He ate and chewed the food, staring at the green wiggling on wall of glass, cascading down from the ceiling to the floor.

"What program, Dad?" Segue moved ahead and stopped, standing in front of the tip slot with a puzzled brow, reaching out for the exposed tip with a smile. "What's this?"

"Don't touch it, son. Come back and sit down in front of me. Finish your dessert like a good boy," Genic ordered with a smile to the back spine of his son Segue.

An array of green colored wiggling line morphed and changed into a single word of capital letters and rich black colors: Zulu Time. Then a musical array of saxophone and piano notes played a jazzy song with a set of red, yellow, and gold colored shooting stars.

Henoana gasped with shock and hugged her teen daughter Igala with a worried brow. "I don't think this is an appropriate entertainment program for the children tonight, dear."

I mouth spat the food over the naked kneecaps with a sour frown, pushing away from my mom to the side of my granny Oltole. Henoana withdrew her arm with a sigh and slapped it into her lap. I frowned. "I'm not a child. I'm an intelligent and smart teenager..."

"Quiet, Igala." Oltole reached over and gently tapped on the kneecap of Igala with a sour frown. "You are to respect your mom and your dad at all times."

I mouth spat more of my food over the naked kneecaps. "Yes ma'am." I watched the wall of glass which was a ceiling to floor television screen made of glass, not soft material as the colored bands of purple and blue danced side to side around the single word in rich black capital letters: Zulu Time.

Segue mouth spat his food over the floor, the table, and his hand with a smile and a nod. "Dad, how did you get this pirated Zulu Time program?"

"This is not pirated, son." Henoana reached down and gently hit the black colored hair roots of her son with a sour frown, sitting back into the soft cushion of the sofa with a set of crossed arms and a worried brow, staring at the rich black word: Zulu Time.

Genic lifted up and pointed an empty fork at the wall of glass with a grin and a nod. "My supervisor rewarded me the cone tip for a job well done."

Henoana uncrossed both arms with a stern face, staring at the wall of glass and reached down for a piece of pie. "Your supervisor could have given you a food tip or a fuel tip, not this particular cone tip." She grabbed the pie with a puff of worry and sat back into the cushions, slicing into the dessert, lifting and ate the food in silence while staring at the wall of glass and the word: Zulu Time.

Oltole exhaled and inhaled without smiling, leaning down and replaced the dessert plate back down on top of the tray, without eating it. She sat back into the cushion with a stern face and a serious tone. "Everything costs coins. I'm not surprised that someone hasn't boxed up all the air molecules and then required payment for breathing. I have lived long enough, remembering. There was a thing called 'free' television. There were about five or six television stations that created television programs for daily morning, afternoon, and evening television folk entertainment. Then the television station executives and shareholders got greedy, charging people tons of coins to watch their favorite sporting event or their dramatic adventure program. Of course, folks loved watching TV. So they paid. Then everyone paid. Now, everyone pays for everything type of television show, now."

"Granny, Zulu Time is the most popular show on the wall of glass. Everyone knows about Zulu Time. Everyone watches Zulu Time, but us. Why is that so, Mom?" Segue mouth spat more of his food over the floor, the table, and his hands with a smile and a nod.

Genic smiled at the wall of glass and the word Zulu Time. "Oltole, you don't have to watch tonight's program with us." Oltole was the biological elderly mother of Henoana.

"I'm fine." Oltole stared at the single word in rich black capital letters Zulu Time as she heard the new rock and roll musical song on the wall of glass.

Segue mouth spat more food over the floor, the table, and his hands with a grin and a nod. "So, if it's not pirated, then you got us connected directly into the Zulu Time station. Zulu Time plays every night, starting at seven until whenever. So cool, I can watch it every evening right after supper. Some of my pals watch it with their parents too. Since, only a parent can access the program code. My pals talk about the great go..."

"Segue, who are these on-line academic friends that talk about Zulu Time to you?" Henoana stared down with a worried brow at his black colored hair roots with concern.

"Just squawk, not talk, Mom! I don't really believe all the stuff my friends said anyways," Segue ate and chewed the pie, staring at the wall of glass and the word Zulu Time.

"Well, I'm afraid that stuff is really true. You are seeing it here on live screen," Genic sipped the beverage and stared at the rick black capital word: Zulu Time.

Henoana shook her curls with a worried brow and stared at the rich black capital word: Zulu Time. "I don't want our children..."

"I'm a teenager." I finished eating, replacing the dirty dish back on top of the tray, staring at the capital letters of the single word Zulu Time, hearing the new classical musical song in the background of the Zulu Time program.

Oltole turned and frowned at the nose profile of Igala with a stern tone. "I do not agree or disagree. But I do believe this is important for Igala to understand the seriousness of Zulu Time. She just turned seventeen years old."

I rolled my eyeballs into the temple of my skull and looked back down at the wall of glass and the word Zulu Time. "I know what Zulu Time is. Everyone knows what Zulu Time is."

Segue mouth spat his food over the floor, the table, and his hands with a grin and a nod. "Can we pay to watch Zulu Time every night like my friend...?"

"No, sweetheart," Henoana shook her curls, exhaling a puff of worry. "This is a one-time-special occasion. Right, dear?"

Genic held his fork of food near a smile. "Your mom is both wise and correct. This is a one-time event, tonight. Therefore, enjoy the action, now. Since, this will be the only time you will get to see Zulu Time."

The single capital word in black colors was replaced with a nice picture of a green grassy park.

Three families were present inside the grassy park on the wall of glass.

One was a portrait of a mom, a dad, two children, and four senior citizens, sitting at a wooden table with two sets of benches for a family picnic.

The second family played with a pair of two dogs, one child, and three senior citizens over the dirt soil in the middle of the grassy park.

The third picture was only a group of senior citizens, who were laughing and eating inside a circle of wooden chairs in front of a set of low colorful plant wildflowers and green bushes.

The female narrator did not present a face and said with a stern tone via the wall of glass. "In the year 2044, the population of the world contains more elderly senior citizens than middle age families."

Segue mouth spat his food with a laugh over the table. "The young dudes and dudettes, like me, outnumbered you, Granny."

"You are very correct, son," Genic nodded with a smile at the wall of glass.

The narrator said via the wall of glass. "In the year 2060, the world is a lovely place to enjoy and raise your children. There is plenty of dirt land for building your dream house with your precious family, plenty of work of paying and productive jobs for money. And there is a slow people population growth that does not challenge or impact our limited earth soil environment like sky, space, and sea."

The picture switched and displayed a group of people strolling and biking over the peaceful city street.

The narrator said via the wall of glass. "Each village has an assortment of family homes inside an excellent infrastructure of city sewers and city streets, providing no property tax or utility services. Since water, sewer, electricity products are free for each citizen within the year 2060. This is all possible because of the Regulator."

Each strolling person inside the grassy park picture turned into a shiny coppery golden colored bald skull with a pair of silver-tinted sun glasses. The sun glasses were rectangular shaped, covering the eyebrows, the eyes, and the earlobes. The throat and the collar bone wore a coppery golden colored one-piece jumpsuit without a decoration of buttons, only a silver-tinted zipper and a matching pair of sliver tinted soft boots.

Laddie sat down on the floor next to Segue and pointed with a giggle and a grin at the wall of glass. "It's a robot."

"Naw," Segue mouth spat his food over the table, the floor, and his hands with a smile. "It's a human, right, Dad?"

Oltole watched the wall of glass with a stern face and a serious tone. "The Regulator is a human without a pair of naked eyeballs or a set of human facial expressions. A Regulator is a special class of people much similar to the old fashioned police law enforcement officer. I can remember. A team of police officers were used to regulate Society's laws and rules. Now, the Regulator performs that job alone."

"Can I be a Regulator, Mom?" Segue mouth spat more of his food over the table and the floor, watching the wall of glass.

"Yes, sweetheart, you can apply for the unique position, once you have graduated Hall," Henoana nodded with a smile.

On the wall of glass, three shots echoed inside the wall of glass.

I jumped from the loud sound in alert.

On the wall of glass, the three coppery golden colored Regulators were replaced with a cloud of black and white smoke. The smoke cleared, revealing three dead bodies that rested in a puddle of red colored blood over the vanilla colored sidewalk inside the grassy green park.

Segue pointed the screen with a gasp and a grin. "Geez, are those really dead bodies on the grass, real people, Dad?"

Genic stared at the wall of glass with a stern face and a serious tone, "Quiet, son. We all want to hear the story line."

The female narrator said via the wall of glass. "In the year 2060, on a sidewalk of vacant boarded up former business warehouses in the city of New York, four shots from two individual hand guns were fired into the crowd of people. The frightened people fled down the sidewalk into the late afternoon window shoppers on a hot Saturday summertime day. The local police law enforcement authorities..."

"They ain't called that anymore," Segue frowned.

Genic ordered with a stern face, "Quiet, son."

The female narrator said via the wall of glass. "Two murder suspects were apprehended and two different types of hand guns were taken off the city street. That same year, a group of representatives of the people, who made laws and rules for all the people, voted to accept a new innovative punishment and a new award system of fairness and justice for the criminal and the victim. The system both enforced and maintained was entitled, Zulu Time."

The grassy park changed into a courtroom with a high bench where a Regulator of coppery golden color sat. The Regulator was positioned between a man and a woman who each wore a pair of white robes. The Regulator lifted up and slammed down the gravel with a soft bang as the loud voices ceased into silence inside the courtroom.

The court gallery overflowed with an assortment of portable television cameras and other unknown people. The long table for the defendant (guilty party) held a pair of two alive and breathing teen murderers, who had killed in cold-blood four innocent citizens. The long table also housed a large group of senior citizens, middle-aged citizens, young children, teenagers, and babies, who all faced the high bench with the Regulator and the pair of white robed man and woman.

The prosecution (innocent party) table held twice the number of senior citizens, middle-aged adults, young adults, teenagers, children, and toddlers, who all faced the high bench also.

The Regulator said with an emotionless coppery golden face and a monotone alto timber. "In the year 2060, the representatives of the people have agreed and approved of Zulu Time, a punishment and an award system for fairness and justice for the criminal's family unit and the victim's family unit. The traditional judge and the traditional prosecution and defensive lawyers have been substituted for me. I am called the Regulator. I regulate the rule of fairness and justice."

Inside the high bench, the dark skinned elderly male in the set of white robes beside the Regulator smiled with a nod. "I am the representative of the people, Buford Turner, ladies and gentlemen. I am present here inside this courtroom and beside the Regulator to explain the one simple rule of Zulu Time. As an entire world faces the first action of Zulu Time, which has not official named that, of course, our complex barbaric society has changed with a far-fetched hope of peace and serenity into ugly violent, again. Violence has existed, before I was born. Actually, since the beginning of time when Eve stole that damn apple and then hit Adam in the nuts. Anyways, no civilized society was immune from bloody murders of murderers and simple thievery of thieves while curtailing the people murdering people. However, one woman was brave enough to fight off violent with a simple tree limb while protecting with her love and her two bare naked fists all her immediate family members. That particular electronic video recording was presented and played over and over again around the world. Thus, Zulu Time was conceived here in the great cities of Society."

Inside the high bench, the pale elderly lady in the set of white robes beside the Regulator smiled with a nod. "I am the representative of the people, Tiffany Evans. Ladies and gentlemen, in this courtroom, you are to feel and see the first exhibition of Zulu Time."

On the wall of glass inside the Smith home, the pictured changed into a fuzzy screen first and then an elder female inside a grassy park, holding a tree branch between her two cupped fists with a sneer.

Segue pointed with a gasp at the wall of glass. "Who's that?"

Genic chewed the pie and stared at the wall of glass, "Quiet, son! Or you'll go into your bedroom during the program."

"Yes sir," Segue ate the dessert and stared at the program.

Then the wall of glass turned into the color of all white.

Segue swallowed the food with a frown. "What's happened?"

The wall of glass showed the two black colored words: Peeker Viewer.

A slot silently popped opened, coming out from the smooth glass wall, revealing an empty hole in the shape of a bloated human body that could fit an upright person.

Laddie frowned. "What's that?"

Oltole gasped. "What's happened?"

Henoana frowned. "A peeker viewer, what do these words represent?"

I frowned at the shifted portion of the solid glass wall which I had never seen with my other family members in confusion and awe. "What's a peeker viewer?"

Segue gasped. "A peeker viewer allows you to feel the action, hear the action, and see through the darkness."

Genic smiled with a nod, motioning with a hand. "Go it, son. Try it?"

"I don't know about this new thing, Genic." Oltole shook her gray bun with a worried brow at the peeker viewer inside the wall of glass.

"Me, either," Henoana reached out and touched the collar bone of her son with a worried brow.

Segue ate one more bite of the dessert, standing upright from the floor and chewed, moving ahead toward the shifted part of the glass wall with a grin and a nod. He walked forward into a gigantic outline of a human and stopped in place as his nose bridge tapped onto the smooth glass. He back stepped with a giggle and a grin from the smooth material.

Then the slotted glass door closed behind his back spine.

Henoana covered her mouth with a gasp.

Oltole shook her gray curls with a sour frown.

Genic clapped with a nod and a smile.

I stared at the solid glass wall with a confused brow. The glass door had closed and sealed the wall back into perfect solid form again like my brother was eaten by the wall.

She jabbed a dirty finger at the wall. "The wall ate Segue." Laddie burst into tears.

Her mother slid off the sofa, squatting and cuddled Laddie, standing upright and turning away from the wall of glass and her son inside with a sour frown. "We're getting a bath for the evening. When we return, your brother will be on the sofa. Don't worry, Laddie." Henoana moved ahead and climbed up the stairs toward the bedroom levels, whispering and kissing the face of her baby daughter for comfort.

Inside the living room of Igala, the solid wall of white colored glass wiggled and changed into a colored picture for all the eyeballs and the eardrums of her family members, but her mother and her baby sister. They were upstairs and away from the glass wall.

His eyeballs absorbed the same picture on the glass wall of the peeker viewer, but his body was standing inside the grassy park like he was really there for a picnic and near the action. The blue and red birds were flying and singing in sweet songs. The invisible cold wind was blowing through the air and onto his naked skin inside the peeker viewer, making his body shiver. The tree leaves were rustling through the air. The insects were buzzing in the air and inside his eardrums.

Underneath a set of the shade over story tall trees, there were two children hugging each other in fear.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue could hear the sobs and see the running tears coming from each one of their tiny faces.

Three tall teenagers moved ahead over the grass with a crunching noise and pointed at the elderly female with a set of curled lips of mouth drool and a ting of nervous laughter.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue could hear the vile remarks, the nasty sneers, and the foot prints of the boot soles.

The tallest teenager yelled at the elderly female with a sneer and a sour tone. "You're in the wrong place, right now. Move along to the next spot. This is our home, woman."

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue covered both eardrums from the loud volume of the tall teenager, hearing the yell and the sneer.

The elderly female shook her curls, squatting down and lifted up a dried out tree branch from the grass, shaking her body and the tree branch at the three mean teen boys with a sour frown. "I'm providing a home for my family here. That's all. Don't want trouble, sir."

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue could hear the panic in her voice and see the dried tree bark and the dead brown leaves fell down to the grass.

"No problem, old lady. Just leave like a buzz, buzz bee. This is our honeycomb spot for our nap," he laughed and leaped at the elderly female, hitting her body, punching into her chest.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue screamed, hearing each fist punch from the teenage onto the breast of the old woman, feeling a pain inside his own chest cavity as he breathed in shallow air molecules. The peeker viewer was using a set of air molecules and forced air to simulate each fist punch from the digital teen onto his real flesh and bone chest.

The woman pulled away from the tall teenager, coughing for air and reared back with both arms, hitting the tree branch into the collar bone of the teen. The teen screamed in pain.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue screamed again, falling down to his kneecaps over the floor of glass from single air-punch hit onto his collar bone like on the tall teenager and covered both eardrums from the loud volume, hearing the grunts of the teen and the whines of the woman plus he heard the pops and creaks of the tree branch on the tall teenager's body parts.

The tree branch was knocked away by the tall teenager out from her hands as a short teenager ran ahead toward the elderly female with a yell.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue yelled in fear, hearing the tree limb hit the ground with a soft thud, running feet of the short teenager over the grass with a set of loud crunches. The woman screamed in terror and fright over and over again inside the earlobes of Segue.

The short teenager rotated a pair of two folded fists, charging and hit on her eye socket, her cheekbone and her jaw line, knocking the elderly woman down into the grass with a loud thud. The female stood upright and back stepped over a smaller tree limb, squatting down and stood upright again, shaking both the tree limb and her bloody arms at the two laughing teenagers.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue screamed again, feeling an air-punch onto his eye socket like the black eye of the old woman and then felt the air-punch onto his cheekbone, falling to the side wall inside the glass compartment with a loud grunt. He felt the air-punch into his jaw line and tasted salt on a tongue as his red blood spilled over his lips and heard the grunts and laughs of the teenagers, the whines, and the cries of the woman, and the creaks of the old dried out tree limb inside his eardrums.

The elderly woman swung the tree branch at the shorter teenager, hitting the teenager in the face, creating red blood. Her children screamed with fear. The children stood upright from the grass and turned away from their mother, dashing ahead and behind an array of low green plant shrubs and colorful wildflower bushes, hiding from the three mean teenagers.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue yelled from fear, feeling and hearing the pop of the air-punch on his nose. His nose was streaming down a tiny roll of his own red colored blood. He heard the creak of the broken dried tree limb, break, and fall down to the ground and high-pitched screams of the children. He rolled side to side onto a back spine from the painful air-punches over his body as his blood painted inside of the glass walls with red stains.

The tall teenager stood upright from the ground with a sneer and ran ahead, stopping and stood next to the shorter teen. Then they both leaped and jumped at the elderly woman, hitting her face with four fists.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue screamed, feeling an air-punch on his face as more of his blood flowed down both cheekbones. He heard the screams of the children, the grunts of the woman, and the laughs of the teens, echoing inside his eardrums, closing his eyeballs.

The woman reared and swung the shorter and broken tree branch as the tall teenager caught and ripped the tree limb from her smaller hands, tossing it aside. And then the three teenagers ran and beat down on the woman again. The children stood upright and scooted away from the plant and flower bushes, running ahead and stopped, kicking the rear leg of each teenager. The teenager turned away from the mother and grabbed the hair roots of one of the children, roaring at the young child and released a hand of black colored locks. And then the children turned away from the mean teenager and ran back, hiding into the bushes with screams and wails.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue stood upright with a yell of fear and fright, feeling more air-punches like a pair of hands over his entire body. The tree limb fell down to the grass with a soft thud. He could hear the soft foot prints of the teens and the screams, grabbing his chest and his face. Numerous air-punches hit both his cheekbones and his chest, cutting into his naked skin as the blood popped and dropped down over the glass floor. Then an air-punch kicked into the lower leg muscle as Segue fell forward into the glass wall, lifting a hand to hold his bloody nose. The top of his hair roots jerked backward from the air-pull like the teen on the small child. He exhaled with a huff of pain as his body ached like the old woman in real pain and real blood.

The woman dropped and landed on top of the grass in a puddle of her blood as the short teenager stood over the female with a smile and then squatted down into her bloody face, twirling a knife and leaned down and sliced her skin. Her blood sprayed into the air and hit the glass screen.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue hit the rear of the glass wall with a scream, sliding down from the impact of the air-punch into his chest, seeing the blood on her face and heard the crunching foot prints of the teens and the loud sneers. The air-punch sliced across his arm, creating a tiny baby cut of blood. He reached and covered his arm with a grunt. The face of the teen enlarged and covered the glass screen in front of his eyeballs.

The tall teenager stood upright at the feet of the old woman and pulled out, twirling a hand gun with an evil sneer and a wicked grin. The elderly woman mouth spat blood with a pair of swollen eye sockets of blindness with a whisper to the tall teen. "I want a safe place for my family. No trouble. No harm. I want just and justice."

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue saw the teen's face and then it was replaced with the old woman's face as she spits out blood and mouth spat over the wall of glass. He screamed and covered both eyeballs with both hands.

Inside the living room of the Smith family, the entire wall of glass went black. Then a single gunshot sounded and echoed throughout the house speakers.

The peeker viewer door slid open in silence. His heart stopped and re-started with the visual and audio horror. Segue screamed with fear, falling backward, flying out from the cubby hole and rolled backward over the soft carpet with a set of heavy breathes and a bloody face and two arms.

Oltole gasped and shook her curls with a sour frown, still sitting on the long sofa next to Igala.

I screamed with fright and worry, pointing down at my bloody brother, sitting on the long sofa next to my granny.

Genic stood upright from the sofa and dashed ahead to his son with a worried brow, reaching down and lifted Segue up from the carpet, kneeling over the floor with a gasp. Segue faced his father with a bloody face and body. Genic gasped. "You're bleeding, Segue? Are you okay? What happened in there?"

Segue smiled with a nod, touching the numerous tiny cuts on his face, wiping off the blood and smeared it onto his non-re-designer blue jeans. "It was great, Dad. Yeah. Wow. I felt all of it the punches, the cuts, the grunts. The peeker viewer hits your body with a punch of air when the teen inside the video hit too and then it caused some painful windburn and a set of baby cuts. Every slice. Every kick. Every pain. No big deal. I'm okay. This is great fun. I wanna get and Zulu Time, every night..."

Henoana stopped and stood upright on the staircase with a gasp, running down from the bedroom without Laddie. Laddie was inside her private bedroom, playing on an electronic game. Zulu Time was too violent for the young child. She dashed ahead to her son, kneeling and touched his face, holding back her tears and her sobs of fear and pain of her beaten son. She whispered with fright. "What is this? Blood? You're bleeding a puddle of your own red colored blood."

"No big deal! I'm fine. It's part of the peeker viewer. I'm hunger, thou." Segue scooted around his parents, moving ahead and sat back down in front of the sofa, reaching out and grabbed his dessert again, eating with his mouth open.

Henoana stood upright and turned away from the wall of glass with a sour frown to see each family member. "Well, the evening has ended..."

"Naw," I frowned with a nod. All my friends whispered about Zulu Time in private at the lunch table. I was clueless, since I had never seen one single show, because of my overprotective parents. "I wanna see the rest of the show of Zulu Time. It ain't started yet. That was the old video of an old woman."

Segue mouth spat his food over the table, the floor, and his hands with a nod, "Me, too."

Genic stood upright and returned back to his warm seat on the soft with a sad pout to his wife. "It is for one night only, dear. The glass tip burns up inside the front portal slot after the show ends. That's the purpose for one execution. Pardon the pun," chuckling.

Henoana exhaled with a puff of worry and raised one finger with a sour frown to each family member. "One night only, tonight, so ya betta enjoy the show. This is not being seen here again ever, boys and girls." She nodded and moved ahead, sitting back down into her cold seat on the sofa next to her teen daughter, without eating or drinking, staring at the white color on the wall of glass.

On the wall of glass, the image wiggled with an array of colors in blue, green, red, and yellow. Then the two faces of Jackie and Jaime both appeared side by side on the wall of glass without smiles. Jackie said with a stern face and a serious tone. "That brave and wise woman was my great grandmother Jane Jones."

Jackie and Jaime said with a smile in unison, "Welcome to Zulu Time, the place for just and justice." A new song of trumpets and drums of a jazzy musical song and an array of colorful fireworks of red and yellow flamed over the collar bones of both Jackie and Jaime in the background on the wall of glass.

Then the wall of glass turned in a bright tan colored room.

The room was fashioned into a D-shape with one continuous curvy wall and a long and straight forward wall. The curved wall was colored in tan, without a single art painting or a viewing window of the trees and the sunlight. The forward wall was long and straight, holding a set of vertical objects based on height of each object from big down towards tiny. Each object stood upright and was mounted into the tan colored forward wall.

The upright object was split into two different colors and a set of numerous sizes. A rounded object of bright red tape rested on top of each object. In the middle of the object, there was a large oval shaped section that was covered in part tan colored tape and part red colored tape. A set of two straight lines of tan colored fell down to the floor, coming out from the middle oval shape. Coming from both sides of the middle oval shape, there were two more straight lines which were wrapped and taped in the color of tan also.

A set of two side doors on the curved wall slid open.

A pale skinned female strolled ahead and exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female strolled ahead and exited from the second side door as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together inside the middle of the room with a smile and a nod.

Each female twirled around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jaime and Jackie Jones."

Jackie wore an ankle-length dress of fluffy features of cobalt blue with a set of outlined sweet animal deer face and rounded ears of blue, red, orange, and black. Her blonde hair was piled on top of her hair roots in the colors of pink, green, and brown as she swirled around to see each black tiny glass screen with a smile and a nod. "Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of just and justice."

Jaime wore an ankle length tight fitting dress of rich black color with a set of outlined pink, red, and green dragonfly designs on a face, a neck, and both two naked arms. Her black hair flowed down her back spine with dots of green, red, and white as she twirled around the room to see each glass screen with a smile and a nod. "However, Zulu Time is also the time for punishment. When a vicious vile crime has been committed, the Regulator proclaims the verdict and awards the punishment."

They stopped the whirl and faced the forward wall with a smile and a nod.

Jamie pointed at the row of wiggling objects on the forward wall with a smile and a nod. "The family unit allowed the infant to die inside their loving residential home. The Regulators sadly uncovered that the infant died of massive head injuries from a beating with the hand or a harder object. Therefore, each family member is the criminal and guilty of the vicious crime. In this criminal and legal case, the viewing audience will not act as the jury and the judge this criminal act."

Inside the Smith home, watching the wall of glass and the program Zulu Time, "O man," Segue whined with a sour frown. "I wanted to vote on my com-d." He lifted up and wiggled his arm with a smile, where his com-d was mounted.

"Shush, son." Genic narrowed his eyelids at the wall of glass and absorbed the new information.

"Why do they smile and nod like a beauty contestant? This is a life and death event." Henoana frowned at the Zulu Time program.

"Shush, dear." Genic watched with intrigue the Zulu Time show with a smile.

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jackie slowly whirled around in a tight circle to see each glass screen with a smile. "When an injustice of crime has occurred, each party is presented here inside the Zulu Time Building. And then the crime is given over to a group of Regulators."

Inside the Smith home, Segue cheered with a mouth of food, spitting some of the contents over the table, the floor, and his hand. "Yay, the Regulators are the good guys and gals. Right, Mom? And they are going to be on Zulu Time, too. Are they always on the show, too?"

Henoana frowned at the wall of glass. "Yes, sweetheart, I think. So, are they going to complete the...uh...task?"

"I guess so." Oltole nodded with a sour frown at the wall of glass.

Inside the Zulu Time Building, Jaime slowly twirled around in a tight circle to see each glass screen with a smile. "On the forward wall, there are seven objects, wiggling side to side in the colors of tan and red, sounding like a set of moaning ghosts, too. Since Society City Four does not tolerate cold-blooded murder of any kind, Society punishes accordingly with eye for an eye, hand for a hand, and life for a life."

Jackie slowly twirled around in a tight circle to see each glass screen with a nod and a smile. "Well said, sister of mine."

The two females stopped the whirl and faced the side wall, looking at the closes archway, saying with a smile and a nod. "Come on out, Regulators."

The two side doors slid open.

A line of coppery golden colored upright bodies with a set of matching hair and skin, wearing a matching one-piece jumpsuit exited each door and moved across the floor, shouldering a hand gun, wearing a stern face. The Regulator appeared like a human but with extreme modifications to serve as a Regulator for Society City Four. Two sets of Regulators met in the middle in front of a long cushioned bench of soft tan fabric, facing the wall of criminals, seven wiggling upright bodies.

Inside the Smith living room, Segue jabbed a finger at the wall of glass with a confused brow. "Mom, I see the row of wiggling bodies. Okay. I figured out that it is each person of the family. But each body stands in a different height. Why's that?"

Henoana cringed with the horror at the wall of glass that showed Zulu Time program. The punishment for the dead infant also included every member of the family unit, including the young children, too. The largest adult started the line-up which went down to the smallest body, probably a two-year-old child that was hidden behind a tan and red cloth. She exhaled with a puff of worry. "Well, there must be some really short, short people in that family, sweetheart."

"Shush, Segue! Or you will go up into your room for the rest of the show." Genic frowned with horror and understanding. All the small children were going to die for the punishment of an adult, who had killed the infant.

"Sorry, Dad." Segue nodded with a smile at the wall of glass and stared at the program.

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jackie spun around and faced the back spine of each Regulator with a smile and a nod. "The Regulator will hit the bright red tape inside each oval shape or the smaller round shape at any place. All the Regulators are wearing a pair of earplugs inside each eardrum as the earplugs will muffle the loud sounds. They are ready for action, Jaime."

Each Regulator lifted and aimed the cold barrel of a semi-automatic gun at the red tape on each oval shape.

Jaime nodded with a smile. "We are not. Let's go and hide inside our room, Jackie." She swung around from the row of Regulator with a hand wave and dashed ahead to the side wall of the open archway with a smile.

"Yes, we shall." Jackie spun around from the row of Regulators with a hand wave and a smile, moving back into her side of the wall.

They entered and spun around to face the row of Regulators and wall of criminals with a smile and a nod, saying in unison. "Aim high..."

Then both the doors closed shut.

An array of flying bullets hit the left side of the red colored tape on each body as a musical chord of deep baritone moan sung from each body, echoing throughout the air waves of the large and enclosed room. Then each body slumped forward from the wall, without falling down on top of the tan colored floor. All the red colored tape turned into the color of rich black that represented death.

The overhead lights went black with a set of faint swishing sounds inside the enclosed room.

The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness in unison via the wall of glass, "Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!"

The light came on. The interior of the tan room was both empty of seven hanging dead bodies and the row of shooting Regulators.

A side door on the curved wall slid open.

Jackie strolled ahead and exited from one of two side doors. Then Jaime strolled ahead and exited from the second side door as both the females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together inside the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated around the room in a tight circle, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone in unison. "Good evening from Jaime and Jackie Jones."

Jackie wore the same dress and the facial designs, twirling around in the same spot with a smile, holding the microphone. "Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of just and justice."

Jaime wore the same dress and the facial designs, spinning around in the same spot with a smile, holding the microphone to see all the tiny glass screens on the curved wall. "I am Jaime. I will explain all the rules for any new audience viewers. Each party is allowed to voice their justification case within a twenty-second time period in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your supper time meal. After twenty seconds has ended, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for the criminal or the letter of V for the victim."

Each female spun around with a smile and moved back to a closed door on the curved wall.

The side door of the Cee team hallway slid open first.

Jaime spun around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of three people in front of the long bench of soft fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and turned, scanning the room with a set of sneers, finger pointing on the other side of the room, wearing a set of evening gowns and tuxedos in the color of light blue. Each face was decorated with a set of outlined colorful forest animals of foxes and wolves faces.

The side door of the Vee team slid open.

Jackie turned away from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of people in front of the familiar low bench of soft beige fabric and stopped. Each person in the party stopped behind her and scanned the room with a set of mumbles and grunts, turning and pointing to each tiny television plasma screen on the curved wall, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of orange color. Each face was decorated in a set of hollow outlines of colorful numbers.

Jamie and Jackie met in middle with a smile and a nod, twirling in a tight circle with a hand wave to see each glass screen too.

Jackie stopped the twirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of hot orange. My twin sister Jamie stands next to Cee team. The Vee team claims that one of their children had been chased down and beaten in the face. The child had been covered in wet mud and beaten in the face again. And the child has been bullied with a set of mean ugly names by the child from the Cee team inside the park playground setting, each afternoon. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team."

Jamie stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone too. "I am Jaime. I stand behind the Cee team of soft pale blue. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty seconds of time. Since, each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jackie turned with a smile and handed the microphone to a mature adult male of the Vee team as her sister Jamie turned and handed her microphone to a middle aged woman of the Cee team. They back stepped from the bench and two debating teams, sliding into an empty space on the wall and said in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The elderly woman of the Vee team an orange gown with a face and a neck of red colored solid colored number one and a pair of matching elbow gloves, reaching out, jerking the young boy into one of her rib cages with a sneer as she barely heard the hard crunch of the math number on the cheekbone of her painted face. The fun face paint sung and moved with the bones of the face. "Bully, you are a bully mother to an overgrown oaf. Your son beats and bullies my boy, every afternoon at our shared playground of swings and pretty flowers. Bullying is mean and rude. You are going to live in hell..."

"Yeah," The middle aged father of the Cee team wore a pale blue tuxedo with a pair of red hand gloves and a matching bowtie, yelling with a natural loud voice as a cheekbone with a black colored wolf head howled into his eardrums. He scooted around his wife, grabbing the microphone from her, jabbing a finger at little boy. "Boys and girls need guts. Your boy needs a diaper and a bottle. Life is hard. You make your kids tough to face a tough life. You're a wussie, lady."

The room went black as the voices faded into silence.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The deadline of twenty seconds has expired.

Jackie smiled with the darkness. "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only."

Jamie smiled with the darkness. "If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl."

They both smiled within the darkness. "Please illuminate all the glass screens now inside Zulu Time."

Inside the Smith home, Segue lifted up and punched a vote into his com-d with a smile, since it was registered in his name. "I voted for..."

Genic lifted up and punched a vote into his com-d too with a grin. "Do not share your vote with anyone! It is not allowed..."

Segue frowned. "But this is my home..."

"It is not allowed. It is against the Zulu Time rules." Oltole frowned at the blackness of the glass wall, since she was not interested in voting in Zulu Time and did not possess a com-d either.

Segue frowned. "Yes ma'am. But I'm going to win for shore...."

"Let me be clear here. This is not winning. This is real life." Henoana sneered and refused to vote on her necklace com-d as a participant on the mentally sick live program, where death was planned and paid by the audience.

Inside the Zulu Time Building, the thousands of tiny glass screens showed a black colored background with one single letter in stark white.

Jamie smiled within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Dang, I am surprised. Are your surprised, Jackie?"

Jackie smiled within the darkness too, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Darn, I am in awe, too. Are you really in awe, too, Jamie?"

Jamie and Jackie smiled within the darkness in unison. "The highest mathematical number coming from all the glass screens wins the justification case. The highest number of letter is C for the criminal team."

The tiny lights of millions of glass screens went dark. The dark room echoed in a series of loud screams and harsh curses plus the sounds of soft rips and tears of fabric. Then the room was silent.

A few minutes later, all the lights illuminated in the Zulu Time room, again.

On the forward wall, there were three objects that stood in height from tallest down towards shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages, cascading down from the hair roots to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

Jackie twirled around to see each screen with a smile. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, each Cee team member must participate and accept the judgment. Thus, the Vee team has lost the justification case. Now, each Vee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of tan and the pretty color of red against the forward wall for justice. Each Vee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment too. Thus, the Vee team is sentenced to death by means of the Cee team's fun and creative methods on the wall of criminals."

Jamie swirled around to see each glass screen with a smile. "Cee team, please select your pleasure. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. Pick out whatever suites your heart and your hand. This part of Zulu Time is choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Cee team member must fire one weapon at one oval shaped object and kill the wiggling object on the forward wall. A Cee team member will know a kill shot has occurred when the oval shaped object has turned into the color of rich black, covering the tan or red tape. And I do believe that our evening audience is filled with a set of bullies, too, since the bullies win tonight."

The Cee team members huddled with a set of secret words and then turned, fanning into three smaller groups in front of the bench of soft fabric. One member leaned over and slapped the lid with a hand as the lid lifted and displayed an array of deadly weapons.

Jackie stopped the whirl and stood behind the back spines of the Cee team with a hand wave and a smile. "This is an interesting dilemma. There are six Cee team members, but three Vee team members. So the Cee members have to pair up. This is okay."

Jamie stopped the swirl and stood with a smile behind the back spines of the Cee members too. "It is okay, as long as, each member of the Cee team fires a shot at the oval shaped figure in front the paired members."

Each Cee paired team member reached down and selected a different weapon and held it inside one hand. One team member slapped down the long lid closed. The six Cee team members stood in front of one of three oval shaped objects against the wall of criminals in silence.

Jaime nodded with a smile. "They are ready, Jackie."

"And we are ready to roll, too." Jackie smiled with a nod.

The two females spun around from the Cee team and the wall of criminals and dashed ahead toward the opposite side of the wall, moving forward into the dark tunnel. Jackie and Jaime spun around and stood inside the archway for safety with a smile and a nod in unison. "Aim high..."

Then both the doors slid closed.

The first pair of the Cee team separated as one member back stepped and stood against the curved wall, out of arm span of her husband. The first person, her husband stood in front of the first object, wearing a pale blue tuxedo with a pair of red colored hand gloves and a matching bowtie with a black colored wolf head that howled into his eardrums. He held a double-sided wood chopping axe over his hair roots. Then an arm shot forward. The axe brightly twinkled underneath the array of artificial lamps on the ceiling, soaring through the air and hit the stomach of the tallest oval object on the wall of criminals.

The voice of the male screamed in pain.

Then a second axe from the first person of the Cee team released and twirled through the air, hitting the throat of the largest oval object on the wall of criminals.

The arms and the legs on the first and largest object on the wall of criminals, the male flew into the air and dropped back down by his sides as the tan colored tape turned into silent black death.

Inside the Smith home, Henoana reached down and covered the eyeballs of her son. "Don't, Mom!" Segue slid down and ducked away from her blinding hand, seeing more of the non-bloody action inside Zulu Time on the wall of glass with a smile. "There's no blood. I like the twirling axes. That's cool. How does he know how to do that maneuver, Dad?"

Inside the Zulu Time room, the husband back stepped from the bench and stood against the wall. The other team member of the first pair, the female (wife) wore a pale blue evening gown with a pair of matching elbow gloves and a cheekbone with a red colored fox head that growled into her eardrums. She moved ahead and replaced her husband in front of the fabric covered bench, stopping and stood in place, holding a small hatchet in the air and above her hair roots, rearing back and launched an arm, releasing her gripe. The hatchet twirled end over end in the air and hit the largest object in the middle of the chest. The red tape did not change color as it was already black colored, coming from the two other tossing axes of the husband.

Inside the Smith home, "Why did she hit the same dead object?" Segue stared at the program with a confused brow.

"It is part of the Zulu Time rule, that every member must strike an object." Genic smiled at the program.

Segue frowned. "But the man's die..."

"Enough! We have seen enough." Henoana stood upright from the sofa with a stern face and a serious tone.

"Naw, Mom." I frowned with annoyance at the wall of glass and the program of Zulu Time. All my friends watched Zulu Time but me.

"There's no blood, dear. This is the only night." Genic couldn't peel his eyeballs off the glass wall either.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the second pair of Cee members separated apart. One (the elderly man) back stepped into the curved part of the wall for safety from the tossing weapon. The second member stood in front of the bench, holding and aiming an automatic cross bow at the second object on the wall of the criminals. The elderly grandmother wore a pale blue evening gown with a pair of elbow gloves and a face design of a red fox that growled into her eardrums and pressed the trigger, shooting the arrow at the second object on the wall of criminals. The arrow soared into the skull of the second object as the red taped turned into rich black of death.

The second object on the wall of criminals, the female of the Vee team sounded with a tiny yelp and then swiftly died.

Then, a second arrow flew from the electric cross bow of the elderly grandmother and hit the throat area of the dead second object on the wall of criminals and then a third arrow discharged, hitting between the twenty-four ribs of the rib cage of the dead second object on the wall of criminals. The tan colored tape turned black on the skull and the chest cavity.

Inside the Smith home, Segue puffed out a set of food particles over his legs and the floor. "She's dead. Why is he shooting over and over again?"

Genic shook his head with a grin at Zulu Time on the wall of glass. "I can't answer that, son."

"My buddies will know." Segue nodded with a grin at Zulu Time on the wall of glass.

"You are not to discuss with your buddies." Henoana frowned at Zulu Time on the wall of glass.

"Shush, Segue. Or I will remove the glass tip." Genic smiled at Zulu Time on the wall of glass, feeling annoyance at his son.

"Shut up, toad." I kicked a naked foot into the back spine of my brother with a sour frown, staring with intrigue at the horrible and painful deaths inside Zulu Time. I wondered what my Hall mates thought of the death action.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the elderly grandmother lowered down the electric crossbow on top of the soft fabric of the long bench, back stepping from the bench and weapon with a smile, slamming her back spine into an empty spot into the curved wall, watching the rest of the deaths.

Her husband, the elderly grandfather wore a pale blue tuxedo with a pair of red hand gloves and a matching bowtie with a brown colored wolf on the cheekbone that howled into eardrums. He moved ahead from the curved wall with a smile and stopped, standing in front of the bench and the weapon with a soft chuckle. He reached down and grabbed, lifting up the electric cross bow, aimed and shot a single arrow into the stomach of the dead woman with a soft chuckle. He reloaded a new arrow and fired it into the right leg of the body with a smile, lowering the weapon back down over the soft fabric and turned with a smile and a nod to see the third pair of the Cee team. He shuffled backward from the bench and the wall of criminals with a smile and a snigger, slamming a back spine into the curved wall between his wife and his daughter-in-law.

The third pair of the Cee team separated and parted. One (the young girl) wore an evening gown of orange with a pair of hand gloves and a face design with a pink colored fox head that purred into her eardrums, skipping and shuffled away from her brother and the bench with a smile, slamming into the curved wall against the empty space with a grin.

Her older brother stood in front of the bench and wore a pale blue tuxedo with a pair of red colored hand gloves and a matching bowtie with a set of two golden colored wolf heads that growled into his eardrums. He lifted up and held the long spear over a collar bone, leaning backward and tossed it into the air. The long spear soared into a high arch and sailed back down toward the floor, hitting down into the tan colored chest of the smallest oval object on the wall of criminals.

The smallest oval object on the wall of criminals, the voice of the young boy grunted with a finally breathe as the tan colored taped slowly turned into the color of rich black, representing death.

The brother reached down and grabbed a second spear, spinning around from the dead child with a smile and a hand motion for his little sister. She skipped forward from the wall with a smile in the pale blue sparkling tea length dress toward the long bench and her brother and stopped next to him, reaching out and grabbed the long spear from his hand. She struggled within both hands to lift the heavy weapon over a collar bone and into the air, tossing it with a grunt over the long bench. The spear flew down into the tan colored matting with a soft thud.

The brother shook a skull in silence, reaching down to the floor and grabbed a second spear for her, handing it to his sister. She accepted the heavy spear and slowly lifted posing it over a collar bone with both hands again and tossed it ahead and over the bench for a second time. Then the spear flew down into the tan colored matting for a second time with a soft thud.

The brother reached down and grabbed a third spear with a worried brow in silence.

Inside the Smith home, Segue frowned with confusion at Zulu Time on the wall of glass. "Why's he doing that? The kid is dead."

"Each member has to hit an object as a playing participant in Zulu Time." Oltole frowned at Zulu Time on the wall of glass.

"O. That little girl has to hit the object. She's too small with that long, long spear." Segue frowned.

Genic nodded with a smile. "Indeed..."

"What happens if she does not hit the tan colored wrapped dead kid with the long spear?" Segue frowned. "Is that a boy or a girl dead child on the wall of criminals? I can't tell."

"That is the point. Criminals are faceless when sentenced to a crime." Oltole looked down with a stern face and fiddled with the hem of her old dress, without watching the screen.

"She...we wait and see, son." Genic cringed at his vile thoughts of something bad for the cute little girl, if she did not hit the smallest oval object on the wall of criminals inside Zulu Time.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the little girl exhaled with a puff of frustration, climbing and knelt down on the top of the soft bench as her tea length dress sparkled in pale blue twinkles on top of tan fabric. The brother handed a third long spear and moved back to watch with a worried brow. She struggled with the long spear from exhaustion, lifting it high and over her colored ponytail of pink, red, blue tones of girly fun and pitched the weapon into the air. The long spear went a little further into the air as the sharp blade landed on top of the tan colored matting for a third time with a soft thud.

The brother exhaled with a huff of worry, swooping up the last spear from the floor and moved ahead, stopping and stood behind her rear skull, leaning down with a whisper into her face. She nodded and stood on top of the long bench, reaching out and grabbed the long spear. Her brother kneeled and wrapped both his arms around her standing legs and shaky kneecaps.

Inside the Smith home, Segue frowned. "What's he doing?"

"Watch, son!" Genic knew the answer but did not want to miss the thrilling action inside Zulu Time.

Inside the Zulu Time room, her brother ducked a head and a collar bone down and away from the wavering long spear as his sister twisted and held it over her hair roots again with a set of heavy breathes. She leaned back and tossed the spear into the air. The long spear launched and sailed through the air waves, arching at its peak, falling down toward the mat. Then the sharp tip of the blade landed on the tan colored leg of the smallest oval object with a soft thud.

The lights went black.

Inside the Smith home, Segue stood upright from the floor and dashed toward the peeker viewer with a smile, slapping the glass with an index finger.

"What are you doing, son?" Genic frowned with confusion, looking at the back spine of Segue.

"I wanna see inside the peeker viewer during the lights out."

The glass portion popped open, standing away from the glass wall for entrance.

Segue entered the peeker viewer slot. The door closed behind his buttocks in silence. He leaned down into the glass, fogging the smooth surface with his heated breath as his two eyeballs adjusted to the tiny streams of infrared light of heat and bodies.

Inside the Zulu Time room, there was no clapping or cheering or hugging.

The brother lifted his sister off the bench and placed her down on the floor. She turned with a smile and skipped ahead, moving to her parents. The parents huddled and hugged in a tight circle and then they all spun around from the bench and the wall of criminals, moving toward the side door of the Cee team. The Cee team door slid opened.

Just and justice had been served inside Zulu Time.

The lights came on.

Inside the peeker viewer of the Smith home, Segue screamed and covered his burning irises, falling backward against the hard glass, hitting it with his buttocks. The peeker viewer door slid opened in silence. He rolled backward with a laugh onto a back spine with a grin. "I saw it." He jumped up from the floor and spun around with a smile and a nod, waving both arms and hands.

The peeker viewer door closed in silence.

I frowned with confusion. "Saw what, toad? What did you see inside the peeker viewer?"

"I saw within the blackness the people. The family of the Cee team turned and moved out of the room without clapping or cheering or nothing. Ain't that strange? I would be hooting and jumping up and down, celebrating the killing..."

"Sit down, son! Or do you not remember my first warning?" Genic frowned at his son. Segue ran ahead and slid over the carpet, twisting into the same spot over the floor in front of his mother with a giggle and a grin of excitement of more Zulu Time.

"Yeah, celebrate a killing of life form." I whispered with a sour frown.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the lights were dark. The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile in unison within the darkness on the wall of glass, "Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!"

The lights came on inside Zulu Time room of tan again.

A set of two doors opened on curved wall again.

A pale skinned female exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female exited from the second side door as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jackie and Jaime Jones."

Jackie slowly twirled in a tight circle around the room in the same dress and facial designs with a smile to see each glass screen. "I am Jackie. Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice. We will explain the rules for any new audience viewers. When an injustice has occurred, each party is presented here inside the Zulu Time Building."

Jamie slowly twirled in a tight circle around the room in the same dress and facial designs also. "I am Jamie. Then each party is allowed to voice their justification case within a twenty-second time period in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your supper time meal. After twenty seconds has ended, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for criminal or the letter of V for victim."

Then each female spun around from the bench and moved back to a closed door.

The Cee team door slid open.

Jaime swung around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of four people in front of the long bench of soft fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind the back spine of Jaime and scanned the room, finger pointing at the tiny glass screens, wearing formal attire in the color of gold with a solid rich black single letter Z on each cheekbone.

The Vee team door slid open.

Jackie spun away from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of six people in front of the same low long bench of soft beige fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of mumbles and grunts, turning and pointing to each tiny television plasma screen on the curved wall, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of light green color. Each face was decorated in a set of outlined colorful woodlands of leaves, pine cones, and other fun figures.

Jamie and Jackie turned from the people and met in middle of the room with a smile and a nod, twirling in a tight circle with a hand wave to see each glass screen.

Jackie stopped the swirl and raised an arm with a smile, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of sweet green. My twin sister Jamie stands next to Cee team. The Vee team claims that the boyfriend of their daughter was stolen by the daughter of the Cee team. The daughter wears over her pretty evening gown the short maroon colored jacket of her boyfriend to prove his and her love to each other. Thus, her life is tainted with a lie of deceit, not the truth of happiness. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team."

Jaime stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile, speaking into an old fashioned microphone. "I am Jaime. I stand behind the Cee team of sizzling gold. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty-second time period. Since each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jackie turned with a smile and handed the microphone to a teenager girl in the first position of the row of the Vee team as her sister Jamie turned and handed her microphone to a different teenager girl in the first position of the row of the Cee team. They back stepped from the bench and two debating teams, moving into the empty space on the wall, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The first member of the Vee team, the teenage girl wore a long off-the-shoulder ankle length light green dress and a body parts on her face, her neck, and her collar bone of a set of hollowed colored tree leaves in the colors of pink, mint green, and brown and jabbed a finger at her former friend with a sneer as she barely heard the musical crunch of the leaves on her painted face. The fun face paint sung and moved with the bones of the face. "Give him back now. He and I are getting married in a couple of years after we graduate Hall. So go away now, unfriendly friend. We are going to be happily married with a set of nice re-generator jobs while you rot in prettiness and beauty of a stone cold death in a marked marble grave, un-friend of mine."

The first member of the Cee team, the teenage girl wore a high collar and long sleeved ankle length dress of golden tint with a smile and a solid black letter Z on a left cheekbone like the rest of her family members. She lifted up and held the microphone into a pair of black painted lips with a smirk. "He loves me. He will marry me after our graduation from Hall, because that is his older brother's jacket, darling." She laughed with her family members.

The teenager girl of the Vee team gasped and then busted into tears, patting on the jacket of the older brother.

The room went black as the voices faded into silence.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie smiled within the darkness in unison. "The twenty second deadline has expired.

Jackie smiled within the darkness. "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only."

Jamie smiled within the darkness. "If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl.

They smiled and said in unions within the darkness. "Please illuminate all the glass screens now inside Zulu Time."

Inside the Smith home, "Whoa, that was awesome. The girl didn't steal the boyfriend. The other girl lied. I know who I'm voting for." Segue nodded with a laugh, lifting up and punched onto the com-d his vote.

I frowned with sorrow at the wall of glass which showed only black colors without music or colorful hues. "I feel sorry for the Vee team teen girl. She was duped by both her bad boyfriend and her mean friend into this vile love triangle. My nice friends would never stab me in the back spine over a boy or a car or a coin. I know who I'm voting for." I lifted up and pressed the com-d with a smile and a nod, registering my vote into Zulu Time, too.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the curved wall showed thousands of tiny glass screens which displayed a black background with one single letter in white.

Jamie smiled within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Unbelievable, I am stunned. Are your stunned, Jackie?"

Jackie smiled within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Incredible, I am almost speechless, too. Are you almost speechless, too, Jamie?"

Jamie and Jackie smiled within the darkness in unison via the wall of glass. "The highest mathematical number wins the justification case inside the Zulu Time room. However, there is a tie for both the Cee team and the Vee team, now."

The lights illuminated inside the room.

Both the Cee team and the Vee team members continued to stand on the appropriate side of the long bench in whispers and gasps.

Jackie pointed at the tiny screens with a smile. "The scores of each registered com-d has voted and tied with the same number of letters C and letters V."

Jamie pointed at the members of each team with a smile. "Therefore, the Cee team and Vee team must continue the debate and the defeat inside the Bowl..."

"The Bowl...." Jackie twirled in a tight circle with a smile and a nod in place.

"The Bowl..." Jaime swirled in the opposite direction in a tight circle with a smile and a nod in place.

Jaime stopped the swirl and tossed an arm in the air as her ponytail wiggled with the sparkles in the air. "Zulu Time has ended."

The teenager girl of the Vee team with a face of colored outlined tree leaves gasped with a frown, turning to see Jaime and Jackie with a sneer. "What? What does that mean? I mean, we vote. I mean, they vote for me and my boyfriend. I am the winner, here, today. I get my boyfriend and her..."

The room went black as the voices of the people went silent.

Inside the Smith home, "What does that mean?" Segue gasped at the wall of glass.

"I do not know." Genic frowned at the wall of glass.

"I know." Oltole whispered with a sour frown at the wall of glass.

Inside the Zulu Time building, inside the Zulu Time room, the light illuminated and showed a tan room without the Cee and Vee team members.

Jamie and Jackie continued to twirl in a tight circle with a smile in the middle of the room in front of the long bench to see each glass screen and then they stopped together.

Jackie smiled with a nod at each tiny screen. "A Zulu Time tie like this has not happened, since the year 2064."

Jaime smiled with a nod to see each tiny screen. "The Bowl is a fake massive geographical place inside the Zulu Time building. Both members of the Cee and Vee teams are gone from here and changing out of their pretty formal attire into a set of working-out clothes to work out inside the Bowl."

Jackie smiled. "We will be moving into the Bowl area, when the teams are ready. We will not be present inside the Bowl, either, since it is too danger for another human."

"We will be present inside an overhead booth, broadcasting the play by play of the Bowl actions and reactions and finale of death." Jaime smiled.

Jackie smiled. "And the Bowl and the teams are ready for some deadly fun action."

The room went black.

09:09 pm (mid-evening)

Zulu Time Building

The Bowl of gray colored sand setting

Inside the Zulu Time building, inside the broadcast booth of the Bowl, the lights came on, showing an enclosed tan colored room without a set of glass viewing windows or a set of tiny black glass screens.

Jackie and Jaime sat in front of a long tan colored counter inside a pair of matching oversized chairs, performing a hand wave and a smile to the roaming camera lenses.

Jackie raised a hand with a smile. "I am Jackie. Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!"

Jaime raised a hand with a grin. "I am Jaime. Welcome to the Bowl, the place of peace and purpose!"

The flying camera lenses soared between the two nose profiles of the two females at the counter, going through an open window of the booth, moving down into a new landscape for a new picture on the wall of glass.

Inside the Smith house, "What's this?" Segue grinned with a nod of the thrilling event, tucking both his kneecaps into a chest. He had never seen this type of warfare entertainment, since his mother monitored all his program shows and his homework assignments.

"We are all interested, too, son." Genic watched the screen with a smile, enjoying the horrible entertainment also.

Inside the Bowl arena, the single camera lenses panned across a bland colored landscape of high mounds and low valleys of gray thick sand with a math dimension of one thousand feet in length.

The height of the area was open-ended, reaching out and touched the full moon, the twinkling stars, and the black night sky.

The landscape area inside the Bowl was the shape of square box. The perpendicular sides of the box, there were two long elevated platforms of gray color with a set of two steel doors.

The set of steel doors cracked and slowly opened outwardly with a set of soft creaks.

The Cee team members moved out from the open archway in a tight huddle, stopping and knelt down over the gray colored concrete surface on top of an elevated platform, scanning the environment with a stern face. Behind the team, the two steel doors closed shut with a loud boom.

And the second set of steel door cracked and slowly opened outwardly with a set of soft creaks.

The Vee team members moved out from the open archway and stopped, standing on top of the opposite elevated platform of gray concrete as the two steel doors closed with a second boom.

The hidden speakers inside the Bowl blasted the words. "Brood of vipers, you are condemned to Zulu Time." The bell rang with three loud dongs.

"Both the Cee and the Vee teams are posed and positioned on top of the platform, without moving forward into the Bowl arena." Jackie narrated from within the booth behind the camera, hearing only voice on the wall of glass into each home. "The Eiffel Tower in the country of France is one thousand feet tall for comparison purposes of the math length inside the Bowl competition tonight. One-foot speed-per-second is measured at .06818 miles per hour."

Jaime narrated from within the Bowl booth behind the camera with her sister, hearing only her voice on the wall of glass inside every home. "At three miles-per-hour, your feet are walk pacing at 4.3999 seconds. Then you can walk this 1000 feet playing field in 233 seconds or three minutes and eight seconds, if you are not in a big hurry."

Inside the Smith house, "I hate word problems," Segue frowned at the Zulu Time program on the wall of glass.

Henoana stared at the Zulu Time program on the wall of glass with a frown. "Shush, son."

Inside the Bowl arena, Jackie narrated without a face as the wall of glass showed the Vee team members on top of the elevated platform. "But if you need a swift foot at eight miles per hour, your feet are fast running at 11.733 seconds. You can run the length of 1000 feet playing field in 85 seconds or one minute and 42 seconds. Wow, Jamie! That is fast. A car traveling at 35 miles per hour can cross a 1000 feet in 19.48 seconds. Makes me wish, I had one of these old fashion four wheeled rubbers to compete in Zulu Time tonight."

Soft classical musical played in the background as the teams worked out inside the Bowl area to the viewing audience.

Jaime narrated without a face as the wall of glass showed the Cee team members on top of the elevated platform. "Tonight, the presentation playing field is decorated in muted pretty gray sand. The Cee team has the choice of the playing field, without giving away any advantage or disadvantage for the Vee team. For any new viewers, this will be a total surprise for you. A Cee team is the criminal family unit that has been accused of performing a criminal action against the victim. The Vee team is the secret name for the victim and their associated family unit. We, as dictated by the Zulu Time, are not allowed to use a real proper name of either the Cee team members or the Vee team members. But that doesn't matter for the viewers. What matters is Zulu Time?"

Jackie narrated without a face as the wall of glass showed the Cee team members on top of the elevated platform. "The rule is quite simple. All members of the Cee team or criminal team wear the bright color of blood red shirts, so you can't see the oozing blood. While, the Vee team or the victim team is dressed in slightly muted shade of baby blue shirts for innocent, dazzling like a silver coin. The single team left standing, even with one bloody member, wins Zulu Time. In case of another tie, which had happened once before in the year 2066, another tie is defined when one or more members of each team survives the vicious on slaughter after the thirty-minute time limit, then the Vee team will forfeit all their lives or all their skulls or all their biological bodies. Since the Vee team claims to be the victim in all this messy mess, the Regulator is not the judge or the jury of crime, only the regulator of the punishment. Therefore, the Vee team will forfeit their right to persuade the Cee team for a second time by terminating all immediate biological lives right here in the Bowl within the program of Zulu Time."

Jackie narrated without a face as the wall of glass showed the Vee team members on top of the elevated platform. "Our sophisticated satellite spy dual cameras will split your glass screen in half, allowing you to enjoy both pursue and hunt of Zulu Time of each team."

The wall of glass wiggled and split in half. Half of the wall showed each Vee team member, climbing down a side ladder on the elevated platform and dropping down inside the gray sand. Then each Vee team member turned and ran ahead, jumping down inside a four-foot-deep gray colored hole, where six individuals stood upright in a huddle of whispers, wearing a set of light blue colored T-shirts, a pair of tight black pants, and a pair of colored running sneakers.

The other half of the wall of glass presented the Cee team members. They wore a set of red colored T-shirt with a pair of faded blue jeans, and a pair of sneakers and stood, holding a weapon in the hand, revealing one sitting dog on a leash. The members shifted side to side, spreading out over the platform without moving.

Jaime narrated without a face as the wall of glass showed both teams. "Our numerous cameras will zoom in and out throughout the event in each team members and spy on their progress or demise. You have entered the Bowl. Let us enjoy the show."

Jackie narrated without a face as the wall of glass showed both teams. "There is not an array of bongs, dongs, or pongs of a musical sound tone. The clock is currently clicking down from thirty minutes, presently twenty-nine minutes, fifty-one seconds. Each team can waste the precious time or waste the precious kill. There is not any rule of who kills whom first."

Jamie gasped. "Look, Jackie! A Cee mate is climbing down the ladder and landed on top of the sand. The tall and slender young teenage female is running and crossed the 1000 feet in..." She studied the time clock on her com-d. "I am checking the clock. Wow. She has crossed in 233 seconds, running at 4.48 miles per hour. I will let you do the conversion math of seconds into minutes. Remember parents? The math figures can help your child further their academic class into the advancement session. If the child mathematical calculates the correct conversion points, then the teacher robot will award an additional academic letter grade for the semester. A child is to identify the numbers of units on each team broken out by adults, teens, children, and babies. An elderly senior individual is included within the adult category since a young mind cannot distinguish between either a strict adult parent or an elderly fun grandparent."

Inside the Smith family, "What's she talking about? Anyone can do a conversion math of seconds to minutes. I can do that inside my head," Segue smiled with a nod at the split wall of glass, showing the Cee and Vee team members.

Henoana turned and frowned at the nose profile of her husband, "Apparently, there's an educational award system set up while entertaining young children into viewing Zulu Time."

"Don't know." Genic stared at Zulu Time on the wall of glass with a smile.

Inside the Bowl arena, Jackie narrated without a face as the wall of glass showed the two teams. "See that, Jaime? The Cee teammate has climbed up and jumped down from one of the taller heap of gray mounds into the air and hit the ground, traveling at..." She studied the clock on her com-d. "We are checking the clock. He travels at 5.02 miles per hour for 198 seconds. How many minutes is that, children? I can't see clearly but the one of the Cee mate's holds a...an animal. There is a medium-sized brown and white dog on top of the platform with the family unit. Very interesting, Jamie! There isn't any rule definition of a killing weapon. The weapon can be a live breathing with shaggy hair follicles, probably with biting fleas. The Cee team mate pats the skull of the dog. I can't make out the particular breed since over the numerous decades all kind of dogs have been killed or exterminated. During the 2020 Rebellion, dogs roamed around and died either from food starvation and transmittal of body disease rabies. A family unit can re-gen a puppy at 100,000 coins."

Jaime narrated without a face via the wall of glass. "Well, the 100,000-coin dog has leaped down from the Cee team platform like a dog, running over the salty lumpy terrain toward the tall mound of gray the hiding Vee team members. Clock that speed!" She studied the time clock on her com-d. "The dog is a German Shepard breed known for speed and intelligent. These animals can run. A German Shepard was used by the police of the year 2018 for chasing down criminals and rescuing people. Well, no individual is being rescued here, folks. This dog works nicely with a family unit and is safe around small children. Very intriguing, Jackie! Since the Cee team doesn't have any small children within the ranks of the fighters, only a set of teens."

Jackie narrated without a face via the wall of glass. "The dog is great guard dog too. The com-d tells me so. And so the clock has tracked the dog at 34 miles per hour through the entire length of 1000 feet playing field in 20 seconds flat. This is a special bonus question for the children in mathematics. What is the speed of a German Shepard?"

Inside the Smith home, Segue frowned at the wall of glass. "She just told you the answer. It is thirty-four miles-per-hour, too easy."

"You are correct, sir," the teacher robot stood on top of the floor inside the archway between the dining and living room, monitoring the educational assignments that was related to Zulu Time.

"Wow, lookie." Segue turned around and smiled to the teacher robot. "It's recording the math answers for school tonight."

Henoana nodded with a frown at the wall of glass. "I can see and hear, Segue. Please, stay quiet."

Inside the Bowl arena, Jackie narrated without a face via the wall of glass. "I am allowed by Society to update the series of academic questions at any time during the live action broadcast. The dog barks at the three members of the Vee team as the members ran from the dog and huddle together for protection. The Vee team tosses handfuls of gray sand into the air at the dog. The dog backs away and barks some more. I do declare that action has made the dog very angry. The dog steps on a right paw forward and then leaps like a tiger. The dog has leaped into the air and latches on the face of the Vee teammate."

Jaime narrated without a face via the wall of glass. "Whoa the stagecoach, Jackie! I have never seen that move coming. The other Vee team members swiftly back step from the viciously dog attack and then run back toward their protective gray mound again. I do not know what is inside the mound or around the mound, since the spy-camera is singularly focusing on the dog's kill. The dog has torn out completely the throat muscles from the Vee team mate, who appears to be a teenager. The red blood is covering the Vee mate's chest and the dog's yellow furry tone. What is the primary color when red and yellow are mixed together? This is another new educational question for the children."

Inside the Smith home, "Orange," I yelled with a smile, watching the bloody fight of the dog and the teenager inside Zulu Time on the wall of glass.

"Red and yellow make the color of orange. Groovy, the dog's skin is turning into a neon bright orange from the boy's red blood," laughed Segue.

Henoana frowned at the wall of glass. "Shush, boy."

The teacher robot stood in the archway and recorded the vocal answers. "You are correct, sir."

Inside the Bowl arena, Jackie narrated without a face via the wall of glass. "Now, the dog uprights a bloody orange face and then rings out all the red blood droplets from his yellow fur into the air. The red blood is hitting the silvery gray sandy ground, producing a color. What color does red and gray produce? There's another educational question for the inquiring minds of the young. My, my, my, tonight, Zulu Time is presenting lots of new challenges in math problems."

Inside the Smith house, "Pink," I grinned with a nod at the wall of glass.

"You are correct, miss," the teacher robot droned and recorded the answer of Igala.

"Pink. The color of mixing red and light gray is pink," Segue laughed.

"You are correct, sir," the teacher robot droned and recorded the answer of Segue.

Inside the Bowl arena, Jamie narrated without a face via the wall of glass. "The dog can't release the skull from its doggie body, so it lowers the human down into the gray sand. It growls and then fangs the right hand of the dead boy or dead body. I do not understand that doggie display, but I guess the dog is ensuring the boy is absolutely dead. Yes, the dog has come to that conclusion as well." She slurped the glass of water into the microphone.

Jackie narrated without a face via the wall of glass. "Let us look at the Cee team now. They have each climbed down off their elevated platform while enjoying the frightful horror show and landed inside the sand. They stand upright and move over the gray sand, getting closer to the deep pit of the Vee team. I do declare that the Cee team will finish the kill first. They are slowly moving at about two miles per hour, slower than a walk. We can call that a victory strut, ya'll. How long will it take the Cee team to travel 1000 feet of the playing field at two miles per hour?"

Inside the Smith house, "The answer is 342 seconds or five minutes and seven seconds." I smiled with a nod at the wall of glass, liking the math test.

"You are correct, miss," the teacher robot droned and recorded the correct math answer of Igala.

Segue looked down with a smile and cheated, tapping on the com-d, "Its 342 seconds or five minutes, seven seconds."

"You are correct, sir," the teacher robot droned and recorded the correct math answer of Segue.

Genic reached over and tapped on the collar bone of his son for the correct math. Henoana reached over and hugged Igala with a smile.

My mom's body warmed my body as I stared with a set of mixed emotions of fear, fright, sadness, confusion, and intrigue at Zulu Time for the first time.

Inside the Bowl arena, Jamie narrated without a face via the wall of glass. "What is the definition of Zulu Time? The Cee team is almost at the deep pit of the Vee team. The Cee teammate carries a construction hammer in a right hand. We inject this educational question every Zulu Time. But it is worth a set of bonus educational points inside your math session, children."

Inside the Smith home, Segue smiled with a nod at the wall of glass. "Zulu Time is the place of just and justice..."

"You are correct, sir," the teacher robot droned and recorded the correct answer for Segue.

Inside the Bowl arena, Jackie narrated without a face via the wall of glass. "The other Cee team members are armed with a set of hand hatchets, a set of arm wood cutting axes, and one portal chain saw that is buzzing in the air waves, but no guns. Guns are allowed, but highly rare used inside the Bowl, since all the companies have stopped manufacturing the deadly weapon, because we have Zulu Time for ending both home and street violence."

Jaime narrated with a gasp and without a face via the wall of glass. "O might, do you see, Jackie?"

Jackie narrated with a gasp and without a face via the wall of glass. "O goodness, yes, I see it, too. There is an army of very large red colored angry ants, coming out from the all the gray tall mounds inside the Bowl gray sand. Surprise, ya'll! There is always a surprise guest inside each Bowl competition."

Jamie narrated with a giggle and without a face via the wall of glass. "I am not surprised. Where do you think all that gray sand comes from? It is an isolated desert, where the nests of ants live. This is very intense. The ants are moving and marching, attacking from behind the back spines of the Cee team members."

Jackie narrated with a giggle and without a face via the wall of glass. "O no! I don't think that the members of the Cee team have seen their new guests inside the Bowl arena, coming up from behind their back spines."

Jaime narrated without a face via the wall of glass. "To complicate the situation, the Cee team has finally reached the gray pit of the hiding Vee team, where the dog is attacking and tearing off a limb from each little criminal. I do declare those are small children of the Vee team members around the ages of five or..."

The glass wall went black.

Inside the Smith home, I gasped. "What happened?"

"Aw, naw! What, now?" Segue lifted up and slammed down both hands over his naked legs with a sour frown.

Henoana stood upright and wiggled the remote control devise in her hand with a smile. "Woo, the evening has finally ended."

"Mom?" Segue continued to sit over the floor with a sour frown and jabbed a finger at the black glass. "I was getting some good bonus points in math for school."

Henoana leaned down and patted his black hair roots with a smile. "Homework? Have all your homework assignments been done, Segue? I always remember that you wait until the last evening hour to finish your assignments which are due tomorrow."

"No ma'am. Okay. Yes, ma'am, doing that now." He stood upright and slowly turned away from the dark colored wall of glass with a sour frown, moving ahead to the staircase, slowly climbing each step with a pout of disappointment.

Henoana turned away from the wall of glass and smiled at the back spine of Segue. "Not very good, son! Has all body parts been washed with soap too?"

"No ma'am. Okay. Yes, ma'am, doing that now, too." He slowly stomped onto the third step with a sour frown, missing the rest of the cool and bloody parts of Zulu Time. Zulu Time program could only be shown on the wall of glass, not any individual com-d.

Henoana smiled at the back spine of her son, "Not very good, son. And you can stay up later than ten o'clock reading or drawing or playing on your com-d until sleepy. Okay, Segue?"

"Okay. Thanks, Mom." He slowly moved up the staircase to bathe and finish his homework for the night, missing the rest of Zulu Time. But his buddies would finish tattling the Bowl ending tomorrow during school session on the wall of glass.

Henoana turned around with a sour frown to see Igala, without a set of spoken words.

I stood upright and lifted both palms with a smirk and a nod. "Okay, okay, help with the tray of dirty dishes and study my re-generator tables to test for re-generator job in the future. I'm going too." I leaned down and gathered all the dirty dishes, placing on top of the tray and stood upright, side stepping from the table and sofa. I turned and moved ahead into the kitchen to aid the ancient teacher robot that worked as the house maid, the lawn service, and the academic teacher until bedtime also.

281st day of the year

07:07 am (early morning)

Warm temperatures and sunshine

Home of Smith family and daughter Igala

Breakfast setting

At the breakfast table, Segue leaned over with a whisper and a grin to see the shoulder of Igala, since he was only nine years old and too short to reach her cheekbone. "That was cool last night. Who did you vote for, Igala? I voted for..."

Henoana leaned over and firmly slapped the collar bone of her son with a sour frown and a serious tone. "We do not discuss one bit of details of Zulu Time from last night. Do you understand me, young sir?"

Segue sat back and looked down with a sour frown at his com-d, "Why not, Mom?"

Igala answered and typed on her com-d to Minki with a sour frown. "We don't. We only slap the wall of smelly paint with their dead names and their sorry dead memories. Why is that, Mom?"

Segue looked up with a smile to see his mom. "My best friend Raydor uses the peeker viewer all the night and everyone night to see Zulu Time. Can I activate our peeker viewer, again, tonight? It was really fun. I wanna see into the darkness again."

"Not never," Henoana looked down with a sour frown and stirred the cold breakfast food with a matching tone.

"It costs a pretty coin to activate the peeker viewer during the Zulu Time program, son. I am sorry. Our coins pay first for our living expenses and then our fun and entertainment second." Genic looked down with a stern face and stirred the food with a serious tone, finishing breakfast and then leaving for his re-generator job for work.

Segue typed on the com-d to his friend Raydor with a smile and a nod. "O. Can we please do it one more time, tonight? Raydor told me that he not only saw what was happening in the darkness like I did. But he felt one of the arms or the legs hits the glass screen from the wounded criminal like I didn't. The peeker viewer was right next to each criminal..."

"Not ever," Henoana looked down with a worried brow and stirred the food without an appetite for breakfast, exhaling with a puff of frustration. "No more peeker viewer. No more Zulu Time. No more of that silly show." She turned and frowned at her son and her daughter. "Please, get ready for your homework lesson, Segue. Igala, you need to leave for Hall, too."

Segue scooted the chair from the table with a sour frown and stood upright, swiftly turning, running ahead toward the staircase and up to his room with a yell and a grin. "Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice..."

I stood upright and back stepped from the table, leaving my dirty dishes on the surface, scanning down at the hair roots of my mom, my dad, and my grandmother with confusion. They seemed to feel guilty about watching the program of Zulu Time for the first time. I felt something weird and different, but it provided a better understanding of painting on the smelly waddle and daub designs over the naked concrete in front of the Hall. I spun around from my parents with a smile of happiness. I was a happy teenager with many more years of life, moving to the closed front door and grabbed the old fashioned handle.

The front door opened.

I dashed down the front steps and toward my ancient car.

The front door of the house closed and locked.

I stopped with a giggle. The car door opened with a soft creak. I slid inside and wiggled around inside the soft leather set, cranking the cold engine with a smile of a new day, reaching out and touched the door handle.

The car door closed with a soft creak.

08:08 am (early morning)

Hall building

Entrance setting

Minki stood next to one of the tall rough columns of the Hall building with a smirk, wearing a new re-designer short dress of purple and green with a pair of new matching re-designer sandals. Her hair was painted in the colors of pink, purple, blue, and green. Her face showed a set of pink and yellow tiny outlines of grasshoppers that whistled when her face distorted. She hid and spied on the back spine and the nice buttocks of Ucal.

Ucal stood upright from his expensive 50,000-coin hover car as the vertical door automatically dropped and locked down into place. He carried nothing but a laugh and a smile, meeting and moving with his best friend Dfee toward the front of the Hall building.

Minki giggled with a silly grin, feeling happy about her life. Ucal would make an excellent husband with a set of great benefits, such like, not working a lousy re-generator job, after she and he had graduated from Hall in another eight months. She could picture a perfect wedding to Ucal in a perfect long white wedding gown here at the Hall in front of the Wall of Memories for faith and fun.

Minki snorted with a laugh. She did not like cute teen hunk Dfee. He was too funny and too full of his cute selfie, almost too overconfident in his academic and his personal life. She didn't understand why Ucal enjoyed the company of Dfee.

Ucal was a kind and gentle teenager, who would become a perfect husband and a father of their child too.

Her eyeballs darted to the long color of aqua as her lips hissed in fury. Her friend Igala was parking that long and ancient car underneath the shade trees, without offering her friend Minki a nice ride this morning to school either.

Minki had received a new hover car on her seventeenth birthday. Then her father wrecked it showing off in front of his silly drunk adult friends on their home property. Now, Minki was without a proper teen transport for a while, depending upon her old grandmother for transportation, going back and forth to her home. So Minki was stuck at her house all afternoon and all evening, while the other teens had fun and went places, like the Re-gen Mall for food and clothes.

However, Minki had not given up on getting a free ride in that ugly car from Igala and conning her nice friend into taking the ancient car to the re-designer shopping mall tonight or tomorrow or the rest of the year. It was only a matter of nagging and brow beating the silly teen girl into the demands of Minki. Since childhood, Minki always got her way or her whines.

Both doors were open at the double archway inside the Hall building.

Twaddle, a middle aged male stood near the doorway with a set of twin bald spots over each eyebrow and a pot belly of good food around a thick middle, pointing with a sour frown and a matching tone down toward the darken hallway. "Good morning, teens. Come inside, teens. Time for Hall, teens. Go to the same place for the same thing. Come inside, teens. Time for Hall, teens."

Ucal and Dfee moved ahead through the parking lot and marched up the wide staircase with a smile and a nod, shoving on each other for fun.

Minki spun around from the columns and dashed ahead, ramming for fun with a giggle into the back spine and the buttocks of Ucal. He slid forward and halted, spinning around with a sneer and a sour frown without a facial design to see the blonde and ugly painted hair roots of petite Minki. "Get back, girl! Ya starting a war or something with me?"

Twaddle smirked at the playful teen action. "Get inside, teens. Go to the same place for the same thing."

She batted a set of re-generator false green colored eyelashes on her re-designer makeup with a set of whistling grasshoppers with a giggle and a grin. "I'm so sorry, honey. I was rushing to get into class with you. I love attending Hall with you. So, I gotta go and attend class with you."

Dfee waved a hand over her blonde and ugly painted hair roots with a laugh as he was taller. "Go on, Mick!"

She turned with a sneer and a sour frown to see Dfee. "My name is Minki..."

"Yeah, a fishy name and a fishy smell," Dfee leaned over and sniffed her blonde and ugly painted hair roots, pulling back with a distorted face and a sour tone. "I don't like your new perfume, the fish of the sea..."

"Yeah," She leaned over and sniffed his body, pulling back with a distorted face and a snarl. "It's better than a puff of fresh hog shit..."

Dfee laughed with a nod. "She's stinky but tells the truth."

Minki scooted around Ucal with a sour frown and dashed ahead, running by Twaddle and into the dark hallway in silence.

Ucal turned and frowned at the laughing face of Dfee, without a set of words.

I parked the ancient car underneath the tall and shade trees again and exited from the seat, facing the Hall building, still feeling shocked and sad about the events of last night inside the Zulu Time building within the Zulu Time program. I really admired my mom for standing up and having the guts to click off the wicked entertainment program. She was both worried and protective over her children. And I wanted to be like her, one day. I ran through the parking lot and hit the mount of tall steps, bounding up and down the steps toward the classroom.

Ucal turned with a smile and a nod to see Igala, reaching out and elbowed the bicep of Dfee with a chuckle. "Now, she can hit me anywhere and anytime."

Dfee turned with a smile and a worried brow to see the girl. "Igala, she's the girl of your dreams?"

"She will be my permanent dream, one day. Watch this!" Ucal swung around with a chuckle to face the open archway and Twaddle, standing in place and blocked the approaching foot path of Igala. She looked down with a stern face and concentrated on each step, without falling down or backward over the hard concrete.

I hit the top step and a wall of muscle, looking up with a confused brow to see the ripping back spine of Ucal. He slowly moved forward with a laugh and a smile to the open archway. I firmly hit his back spine with a folded fist and an annoyed brow again with a puff. "I need to get around you, Ucal. It's time for Hall. I gotta get to my chair and my table."

Dfee stood next to Ucal with a smile and a chuckle. Then he quickly moved around, scooting and stood behind the buttocks of Igala, ramming his body into her back spine with a grin and a chuckle for fun. "Get moving up there, son. We gotta get to class before more dead bodies fall in Zulu Time."

Ucal slowly advanced ahead over the smooth front porch surface as Dfee moved forward and rammed into her back spine with a grin and a chuckle for his fun and her embarrassment, extending and locking in place both his arms around the twin biceps of Ucal.

Thus, Igala was landlocked between the two silly teen boys.

I wiggled side to side without breaking the muscular arms of Dfee with a sour frown and a matching tone. "Hey, I can't get around you. Watch out. Stop hitting behind me, Dwit..."

"Hey, my new name from the cute girl. So, all my names are Dwit and Dfit and Dfun and Dfee that's me." Dfee slowly moved ahead and rammed his chest into her back spine with a chuckle and a grin again without letting Igala escape from the hand hold.

"Get inside, teens. Time for hall, teens." Twaddle stared and frowned at the three silly teens that slowly advanced through the archway.

Ucal, Igala, and Dfee slowly entered through the archway with a set of grunts and giggles, rolling down the hallway like a tiny set of train compartments with a set of laughs and smiles.

Dfee turned with a silly grin to see the frown of Twaddle. "Good morning, Mr. Twaddle, the waddle. How's the wattle and duck, this morn?" He rammed into the buttocks of Igala with a laugh and a smile of a good time at Hall today.

Twaddle rolled his eyeballs into the left temple, looking back at the back spine of Dfee inside the silly train position, turning away from the front porch, dashing ahead and around the group of silly teens, entering into the tent like yesterday, the day before yesterday, and the numerous days, before yesterday. He stopped and stood in front of the naked wall. "Welcome to Wall of Memories! We have all returned here again to honor the ones in Zulu Time, last night."

Minki sat inside one of the tall tables, playing on her personal com-d, hearing the soft claps and silly laughs of the other teens, looking up with a gasp to the silly teens.

Ucal, Igala, and Dfee were slowly advancing into the tent like a rolling train. Igala turned bright red colored with embarrassment of the situation. The other teens were standing and clapping with the fun show.

Minki exhaled with a puff of fury and embarrassment, since she had rammed the buttocks of Ucal for fun this morning, too, but he didn't invite her into the fun playtime train of teens. She sneered with a sour frown and a whisper for her eardrums only. "That girl has to go. Igala attracts way too much of his attention and away from me with her silly childish antics." She narrowed her re-designer false green eyelashes at her friend with a nod and a whisper. "Then I can play the caboose of Ucal, not Igala."

Dfee pulled back with a laugh from her back spine and turned away from Igala, moving ahead to one of the empty tall tables for the morning work assignment, selecting a table for him and Ucal.

Ucal stopped as Igala slammed into his back spine. He swung around with a laugh and cuddled Igala into his chest, waving a hand and a grin to the other clapping teens. He spun them around in a circle and shuffled her toward the same table with her annoyant friend Minki and stopped, standing in place, pulling out the chair like a gentleman with a smile, "Your chair, gorgeous."

I slid into the chair with a smile, looking down to the floor with a red faced embarrassment.

"Hey, Ucal!" Minki turned and batted a pair of re-designer false green colored eyelashes with a grin and a giggle.

He was taller and leaned over the black colored hair roots of Igala, smelling the flora scent with a smile. "Thanks for being a good sport, gorgeous. What are you doing for lunch, Igala?"

I continued to look down with a red heated face at the scratched wooden surface, wiping off the sweat balls. "Eating. Bye, boy."

Ucal rapped a fist over the surface with a smile and a nod to see her black colored hair roots. "See you for lunch, today, Igala." He spun around with a smile to see Dfee at their shared table. Dfee shook his head, raising both arms, bouncing up and down inside the chair for the fun activity. Ucal tossed both arms with victory and dashed to the shared table with Dfee.

Minki leaned over with a sour frown and a whisper to see the nose profile of Igala. "Why were you touching his buttocks?"

I looked up with a gasp and a confused brow to see her sour frown. "I was not..."

"It looked that way. So what were you, three doing?"

I exhaled with a puff of embarrassment, "Nothing. Dfee and Ucal were having fun as usual. You know them, always fun and games around here at Hall? We're teenagers before our next giant step as a boring and dull mature working adult like my parents. I got catch up in the middle of those two silly males." I covered my lips with a laugh of my funny joke. "They're fun. I like having them inside our boring classroom."

Twaddle stood in front of the colored wall with a sour frown to see each teen. "All right now, the train has arrived at the depot. Please stand and work a new set of wattle and daub portraits now. Then we all will return into class to study up for your selected re-generator job. And some of you have not decided on a re-generator job, so I need to see you..."

Ethdamn was a tall black haired teen male with a face of black whiskers, and a tone of pale tinted skin, and a pair of hazel eyeballs. He stood with a laugh, forming a pair of eyeglasses with both hands over a face. "I see you, Twaddle, the waddle. You are right there in front of the wall. You need..."

Twaddle frowned. "Work! Everyone, get to work, right now." He turned and moved toward the single table with a set of soft curses and a sour frown, stopping and sliding into the seat. He opened up the paper notebook on the desk surface, writing down his abused mental thoughts for the day.

I wiped the sweat balls and the teardrops off my face, after the funny but humiliating experience, sliding out from the chair and stood in place, turning to see the orange section of completed wall from yesterday with a confused brow. "Hmm, yesterday, Twaddle told us to finish our unfinished orange wattle and daub over there on the other wall that didn't receive a star fish, but he didn't remind us today. Why's that?"

"They're dead. The dead don't care. We gotta do this for the dead. And I don't care either. I pick the wall portrait today." Minki dropped down her new necklace chain with the com-d and slid out from the chair, standing next to her friend, scanning the room. Her other teen friends Lexedo and Kallidin had been very swift, moving and grabbing one of the empty portraits beside Ucal. She whispered for her eardrums only with a frown. "More competition than I need, today." The other side of the wattle and daub was occupied by the male friends of Keer and Ethdamn. She whispered for her eardrums only. "More rednecks than I want, today."

I turned and scanned the naked wall which contained an assortment of tall and short portraits with an array of pretty bright and dull colorful backgrounds with a sad heart and a sad face. "Now, I completely understand why we do this thing, every morning."

"For torture, for torment, for Twaddle, the waddle..." Minki stared at the back spines of Ucal and Dfee with a grin and a laugh.

I continued to scan the empty colored portraits. "I don't agree. I saw Zulu Time, last night. I sympathized with both the victims and criminals too."

"One team only wins..."

"It would be terrible for some other person that I didn't know or could not see to select me as the loser of Zulu Time. Then you would lose everything..."

"That's the goal of Zulu Time to teach a young child not to do a bad thing. Or you will be invited to appear inside the Zulu Time Building with your entire family unit for Zulu Time and in front of a live audience of tiny black colored glass screens. Ha, you're extremely lucky that your little car accident didn't end up in Zulu Time too."

I turned with a gasp to see Minki. "No."

"Yeah," She nodded with a grin.

I frowned, "No way, Minki! It was silly little car accident. I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't injury any person, only the car. My parents were mad but forgiving."

She laughed with a nod. "I can see that. Your parents are nice and kind, since you are still driving that old car which is parked underneath the trees at Hall, after two fender benders with the concrete post and the hover car."

I nodded with a smile. "Thank goodness, only two metal life forms." I gasped down at her blonde and ugly painted hair roots, since I was taller. "Wait. If I had injured a real person, not a metal object, could I and my entire family have been invited to Zulu Time also?"

She turned with a grin and stared at the buttocks of Ucal and Dfee who head-bumped with a plan for the morning assignment. "You watch Zulu Time every night like me. What's your teenly educated guess?"

"Hmm, I can't really guess. I only saw the one program, last night." I swung around from the wall and moved ahead toward the tub of jumpsuits before selecting the cutters and the colors for the wall assignment.

Minki spun around from the wall with a gasp and a confused brow. "You did?"

I stopped and stood in front of the tub of jumpsuits with a smile and a nod. "I did."

She swiftly dashed ahead and stopped, standing on the other side of the clothing tub, looking at the nose profile of Igala. "You have never, ever seen a second program of Zulu Time."

I selected a jumpsuit, dressing at the tub, sliding over the hoodie with a stern face. "Never, ever. Last night, it was the first and the only and the last time for Zulu Time." I spun around from the tub and Minki and moved back to our shared table for the morning's work.

Minki grabbed a jumpsuit, folding it over her arm with a grin and followed beside Igala with a smile. "Why not?"

I led to the naked wall and halted, standing in front of a pretty blue colored wattle and daub with a sad face. "My parents do not allow that vile stuff into their home. They are overprotective with their children."

She nodded with a grin, stopping and stood next to Igala, looking up with a smile at the naked wall. "Overprotective means weak."

"Maybe, maybe not, it is a sign of care and love."

She laughed with a nod, turning to stare at the nose profile of Igala. "I see Zulu Time, every night. You have gotta be tough and rough with no love to survive in there, if you happened to get invited. And there're lots of ways and reasons to get an invitation too. There's even a com-d site on Zulu Time to read up on all the rules and regulations."

I looked at the wall with a sour frown. "That's weird to have a dictated com-d site for Zulu Time. And that's a funny phrase: Invited to Zulu Time. You do something wrong. Or you do nothing wrong. What shall we decorate today for the poor victims of Zulu Time, last night?"

She nodded with a grin. "I don't know. But if you were a pretend victim of Zulu Time, then what would you like to see on your personal wattle and daub on the Wall of Memories, the next day? Ya know, for pretend."

I shifted back and forth on my boot toes with the weird death question as my mind clicked with a true answer. "That's a good question. Hmm, what would you want on your Wall of Memories?" I turned with a smile to see the blonde and ugly painted hair roots of Minki.

Minki laughed with a nod, waving both hands like she was drawing the picture on the naked wall. "I wanna a bright red background with a pair of naked legs sliding down into a pair of black colored re-designer sandals. And inside each sandal, my ten toes painted in re-designer bright and vivid lavender colors. What do you want on your Wall of Memories within Society City Four, seventeen-year-old Igala Smith?"

I turned with a stern face and stared at the blue colored wet wattle and daub. "I would like to see lots of yellow sunshine, a patch of tall yellow and red sunflowers, and tons of baby blue sky like over a green meadow or something like that."

"That's very nice." She smiled with a nod at the nose profile of Igala. "Yeah, I gotta remember that one."

"I think so, too. I'll go and get the cutters and the colors for our nice memory to the dead." I spun around from the wall and dashed ahead toward the opposite wall for the equipment to finish the wattle and daub for the morning.

She swung around from the wall and followed the back spine of her nice friend with a grin and a giggle. "Yeah, in memory to the dead..."

03:03 pm (mid-afternoon)

Hot temperature and clear sky of sunshine

Home of Smith family with daughter Igala

Living room setting

The front door chime rang.

Segue slid off the chair and dashed toward the front door.

The front door opened.

I worked on the calculus equation at the dining room table, chomping on a little snack before supper time. The calculus equation read: Find the area of the surface that is the graph of the equation f (x, y) = x2 lying above the rectangle Q= {(x, y) - 1<=x<=1, -1<=y<=1} Round your answer to the nearest hundredth.

"Mama, mama, come here to the door, now," Segue back stepped with a smile and pointed at the stranger with a chuckle. "Look...."

I turned with a gasp and stood upright from the chair with a worried brow.

A Regulator in gleaming copper-glory marched through the front door and halted inside the living room. The Smith family moved ahead and formed a semi-circle away from it in front of the open door. The Regulator said without a smile and an emotion to each family member. "You are invited to Zulu Time. The limousine will arrive in fifty-nine minutes. Each member is allowed many luggage units hanging from any and all the body part for vital family protection. Each member does not need any type of additional clothing or a set of daily necessaries, since such like items will be provided at the Cee building. The Cee party of Family Smith will honor the invitation or face the Regulator. Thank you. Have a nice day." It, since it was hard to tell a female or a male human behind the coppery golden colored face paint, back stepped and pivoted, moving back into a parked limousine inside the private driveway of the Smith family. The limousine lifted from the hard pavement into the air and flew away toward the skyline, since no one had bothered to close the front door of the house.

"The shape of a cylinder..." I parted my lips in shock.

Segue turned and giggled to Igala. "What? Its skull is shaped like an egg, not a cylinder, silly girl."

Henoana turned and snapped with worry at Segue and Igala. "Quiet."

I stared out into an empty city street in shock. "I meant the answer to my calculus problem. The surface has the shape of a cylinder. So, I can use a method of integration by trigonometric substitution, evaluating the surface area integral."

Henoana turned and frowned at her husband. "Why are we invited to Zulu Time?"

Genic turned and frowned at his wife. "Why are we invited to Zulu Time?"

I stared out into an empty city street with a meek tone. "I...I had a little car accident with the Old Girl."

"Again?" Genic turned and frowned at his daughter.

Henoana turned and sneered at her daughter. "Silence your silliness! Specific to us now the car accident detail, Igala."

"Yesterday..." I stared with a worried brow into an empty street.

Our house resided in the rural countryside section of Society City Four. Our closest neighbor was a pasture of cows on one side and a pasture of horses on the other side. It was rare to receive visitors to our house, since all my friends lived within inner city blocks of City Four.

Henoana gasped with worry. "My goodness, you were involved in a new car accident, yesterday."

"What's wrong, Mom?" Her five-year-old sister Laddie ran ahead from the staircase and slammed into the naked arm of Henoana, reaching out, grabbed, and yanked on the arm of her mom with a worried brow.

"It works with state of the art technology. With a touch of my finger, I can move mountain peaks, track ants, and see the bottom of the ocean fishes." Segue looked down with a smile and tapped on the wrist com-d.

I turned and stared at my mom. "Ucal compensated the driver of the hover car, a young teen like me. He was driving for the first time too." I was terribly afraid of the dire consequences for Ucal, not me.

Genic frowned at Igala. "Ucal? Ucal and his family are involved, too."

Oltole frowned with a nod at Igala. "Ucal did this. He has tattled on our family to the Regulator. He would know about the car incident and Igala and the driver..."

"No." I lifted and waved both arms into the air with a worried brow. "Ucal helped me. I accidentally hit a parked hover car in the rear end with the front guard bumper of my vehicle. I'm at fault here, not you. I've sentenced my family to Zulu Time. I'm so sorry, Mom, Dad, Granny."

"When did this happen, Igala?" Genic frowned.

"After eleven o'clock, when Hall let out, yesterday. The front bumper of my car was dented in the same place from the previous dent, the other day on the first day of Hall. That's why you couldn't see it. The other car is..." I exhaled. "I don't really know the metal condition of the hover car."

"Who's the other family, Igala?" Henoana frowned.

Oltole frowned, "Yesterday, this happened. Now, we are to join the Zulu Time for this evening's event. That seems impossible and swift to me."

I said. "I don't know the other family unit. I didn't meet them. Ucal..."

Genic turned and frowned to Igala and Henoana. "Ucal is involved in your car accident too. Was his expensive hover car hit and then damaged also? That machine is very, very expensive, Henoana. We might have to pay for any damage to his expensive hover car too."

"No." I waved both hands again for attention from my stunned parents. "Ucal, he paid for the entire repair cost of the rear bumper on the hover car with his own personal coin which was caused by me inside my ancient car. He was traveling behind me, somehow, when the accident occurred. He wouldn't let me leave my car either. He told me to stay instead my Cadillac. He executed the coin transaction while I watched from my driver's wheel. I didn't hear the conversation."

Oltole turned and frowned to her son Genic. "All is not well here, Genic."

Henoana frowned at her daughter. "Why would Ucal know to do that, Igala?"

Genic nodded with a smile, lifting and waving both hands over his black-grayish skull with happiness. "Yes, Ucal knows. Yes, we are saved. Yes, everything is okay. All is well, here, Mother."

"How is that possible, Genic?" Oltole frowned.

Genic nodded with a smile and pointed at the second level of the house. "Get upstairs, kids. Get dressed for Zulu Time, before the fancy limo comes back. We're all riding for fun in style for a thrilling night of daring adventure."

Segue turned and ran up the stairs with a smile and a giggle.

I reached down and grabbed the hand of my baby sister Laddie, slowly spinning from the front door, moving toward the staircase while ease dropping on the adult conservation behind my back spine.

Genic shifted toward the front door, slamming it shut and spun around to see his mother and his wife with a smile and a nod. "Ucal has...knows stuff. His parents would never allow him to get involved in Zulu Time. Zulu Time is too dangerous for a teen or an adult. This is very good news for all of us. Hey, this will put a little excitement into the evening, too."

Henoana frowned. "I don't know. I don't trust Ucal and my own daughter, now."

Genic moved ahead with his mother and his wife toward the staircase, patting both their arms with a smile and a nod. "It was a teen boo-boo thing. No deaths. All the other Zulu Time justification cases are deaths of something or someone. Let's go and get dressed for our swift Zulu Time presentation. Then we will come back home before nighttime. I promise. I feel it in my bones." He watched the women in his life advance up the staircase, stomping up with a nod and a smile to bath and dress also.

Cee Building location

04:04 pm (late afternoon)

Hot temperatures and partly cloudy with sunlight

Parking lot setting

The pre-offered limousine slowed down and then halted, hovering in the air, dropping down, locking on a pair of landing skis on top of the hard pavement and slowly lowered down toward the hard surface. The air vehicle was one of the most expensive and best riding transports that I had ever traveled as my last day within Society City Four, since I was invited to Zulu Time to die for a crime as a criminal.

The four doors slid upright toward the skyline and open at the same time for drama.

A single Regulator stood in the center of a set of double golden doors in front of a tall white marble building for drama too.

I slid out from the re-designer leather seat with a puzzled brow and stood in place, moving away from the car door, stopping and stood between my granny Oltole and my brother Segue to see the Zulu Time campus. There was a short row of three buildings without a nicely manicured yard of grass and pretty beds of flowers or a graveyard of grass and flowers. The landscape was a flat hard pavement surface that matched the walking surface of gray brick, leading into three separate building of varied colors.

Segue looked down with a smile to see the wrist com-d. "All the entrance doors are hand carved wood with a hunting knife. The symbols of life come from every known civilization in the world, since the Babylonians. For us, one of the symbols is a hand with an index finger and the middle finger, forming that letter V for victory...."

I whispered for my eardrums only, "Victim, them. We, criminals."

The building had a giant letter C for criminal family, the Smiths or the single criminal person Igala. I was so careless to cause the car accident, now I had placed my entire family literally at the entrance of death's doors.

I wished for the beginning of the week, shading my eyelashes from the bright sunlight. My granny reached out and shoved the shoulder of Igala toward a set of closed wooden doors of the Cee Building. I tripped over the smooth sidewalk with nervousness.

The limousine lifted up from the pavement and flew away from the Zulu Time campus.

There were three buildings ahead of the Smith family. The Cee building almost touched the blue colored skyline next to a short dark wooden building that rested next to a much shorter squat pink-tinted building. The pink-tinted building had a set of wooden doors too.

The center building was made of wood and possessed a set of dark wooden doors without an alphabetic letter

Oltole leaned over with a smile into the eardrum of Igala, moving toward the Cee Building. "Marble. That's pink marble with a pink rose color tint. Pretty, isn't it?"

The single Regulator spun around from the Smith Family to face the wooden doors. Both the wooden doors automatically opened up into the Cee Building. The Regulator moved into the dark hallway as the leader of the invited group of criminals, the Smith family.

Inside the interior white colored hallway, her father Genic and his son Segue moved inside with a springy step, whispering and pointing to the walls. Her mother Henoana and her baby sister Laddie followed behind the back spines of Genic and Segue.

"Yes ma'am." I cut my eyelashes to the letter V on the pink-tinted structure, moving beside my granny into the Cee Building, bumping into her shoulder with nervousness, since we were both the same height. I folded both arms around a slender body with a worried brow and a whisper. "It's cold in here."

"The cold don't need warmth." Oltole said with a whisper, keeping her voice from echoing off the solid walls, floor, and ceiling.

I moved down a long empty corridor, narrowing my eyelashes ahead to see more smooth white marble with a confused brow. "What does that mean, Granny?"

Oltole pointed to each side wall with a stern face and a whisper. "The walls are solid marble, pretty white like a birthday cake with tiny sprinkles of gold paint. Ya see that there?"

"Yeah," I whispered. The smooth hard floor connected and rode up each side wall toward fifty feet or more into the ceiling space and made of the white colored marble. The marble felt ice cold underneath the thick socks and the thin soles of my worn and unpolished black and white cowgirl boots. Each tall golden metal urn holds a beautiful fiery plume of flames, glowing against the white marble in the rainbow of colors from pink, purple, orange, yellow, blue, red, orange, silver, and gold. "It looks so serene and peaceful. Is that the purpose, Oltole?"

Oltole nodded with a whisper. "I guess it could be interpreted that way. It's both beauty and bland." She pointed around the enclosed hallway of white hue. "Behind the walls, below the flooring, and even above our heads are the dead bodies." Igala halted with a gasp of fright, turning to see a taller white wall of coldness and a tall red colored urn of heat, not a pile of gray ashes. Oltole said. "This is designated as the criminal building. Ya saw the pink marble building? That's the victim building. It is small now, but it is steadily growing taller too. They plop a busted bloody dead body one on top of another, an entire family unit resides within these walls.

"Over the decades, the criminal or Cee team, the nickname stuck like glue, pretty much died almost ninety-nine point ninety-nine of the time. In the historical past, the criminals were really and truly thugs, rapists, thieves, and murderers. They came from broken family homes within Society with nothing better to do but fight and then steal or kill. Since the introduction of Zulu Time, the Cee team was totally destroyed, including the immediate kin folks. The Vee team took possess immediately of the asset properties of the criminal family, such as, the land, the house, the furniture, and the coin, if any. Then the Cee team had nothing left but a broken bloody body or a group of bloody broken bodies. The people representatives didn't want a vile criminal of Zulu Time to be buried inside a city gravesite, so they can up with the ideal of a..."

"Monument."

"No, child. This is a marker for folks to remember. When you break the law, you become a criminal and then you fight and finally you die. You are placed in here, resting and wasting away from the warmth of the ground inside a cold flat box of stone, not being able to touch the sky either like your heavenly soul is stuck in limbo. Once the violent criminal element was eliminated, the representatives of the people dissolved the fair judicial system of human judges, human juries, and human lawyers. And then they created the Regulator. If you are mistreated, then you file a complaint with the Regulator. If you are mistaken, then you are invited to Zulu Time."

I gasped. "That's unfair, not right."

"Correct, child." Oltole nodded.

I nodded. "So you believe that Ucal has somehow saved us from Zulu Time too."

"I don't rightly know, child. I don't know his family. His grandmother lived next door to my mom Mae Smith. But I didn't know her either."

"So maybe, this is just a formality of Zulu Time, entertaining a compliant with the regulator."

"Might be, I don't know the rules of the Regulator. I have faith in your dad, Igala."

I whispered for my eardrums only. "I don't." I looked down with a worried brow to see the marble with a set of new knowledge. There was a pile of preserved human bones and dried blood proteins lingering between me and that wall and that ceiling and that floor. Chills invaded my back spine of creepy and coldness.

The single coppery golden colored Regulator from the entrance doors paced ahead without talking with its words or pointing with its fingers.

There was a second set of double doors in glittering golden tint at the end of the straight corridor. There were two giant urns of fire, shining against the golden metal. The building did admit a single ray of bright sunlight, thus the heat of each flaming urn provided the only source of light too.

The single Regulator stopped and pivoted in the front of double golden doors as the fire light stretched and illuminated the copper color into a yellowish gold, making the Regulator a glowing angel for a few seconds. Then the Regulator side stepped into the side wall of white marble, hiding between one of the fire urns, without talking or pointing.

Inside the Cee chamber suite setting, her father Genic stomped ahead and stopped, standing between the two wall corner urns of blazing fire pits, activating the set of glittering golden tinted double doors. He and Segue entered and disappeared into the mystery Cee chamber suite of rooms.

I stopped and bumped into her shoulder again as we were the same height of biological DNA, waiting for my other family members to disappear into the mystery room, moving ahead with my granny into the space. The next space was a long and wide rectangular hallway in white marble on the walls, the ceiling, and the floor too. There was a set of square shaped archways in white marble on each side wall, as far as, I could see. I stopped and stood in front of a matching white rounded marble island like a standing table, without a set of sitting chair a few feet inside the entrance of the long hallway.

Laddie ran from her mom and danced toward the first square archway on the side wall with a smile and a nod of curiosity, entering through the open archway and disappeared into the room.

Henoana stood on the far of the rounded marble island, looking at the golden tinted entrance doors, turning with a worried and a whisper to see her husband. "What do we do now?"

Genic ran both hands over the smooth marble island with a smile and a nod, standing on the side of the marble island. "We wait on Ucal, of course. He knows what to do. He will show up right here and then lead us back to the fancy air limousine and then the limo will take us back to our home. All's is well." He turned and smiled to Igala. "I like that boy, Igala. He's smart. Be a good protector, if you want a family, some day."

I leaned against the front of the heavy marble island with a back spine to the entrance doors, looking down with a worried brow and tapped, pinging on my com-d, finding all the rules of Zulu Time. And then I started reading in silence.

Laddie exited from the first room and stood inside the archway with a smile and a nod, pointing into the room with a yell. "A bed in there, colored in yellow. Don't like yellow." She turned and moved ahead, stopping and stood inside a new arched doorway with a smile and a nod. "Yeah, I like orange and red flowers. A big bed for three or four of me." She entered a new room with a shout of happiness to her relatives. "Color of purple, the bed and poles. Don't like that either."

Segue ran ahead and stopped, standing inside the archway of the new room which was further down the hallway, pointing into the space with a smile and a nod. "This bedroom has a bed and a tree of sticks inside a glass vase. Don't wanna break nothing!" He back stepped with a giggle and side stepped into a new room with a smile. "The color's white. Don't like white. I want something in blue or black."

Laddie back stepped from the archway and turned away from the archway, running down the hallway to new room, standing in the archway and pointed with a smile and a nod at a new room. "Here, bed is pink, yellow, green flowers. Like but don't wanna it." She back stepped and turned from the archway, running down the hallway to find a new room.

Henoana scooted from the island to face the back spines of Laddie and Segue with a puzzled brow, slowly moving down the long marble hallway, observing all the open archways of each room and reached the end of the hallway, entering the last room, disappearing through the archway.

Laddie stood in place inside the archway of a new room and jumped up and down on her cowgirl boots. "Wow, princess room. A princess coach in gold with silver wheels and a ladder. Here. Here. My room. My room. My room..." She entered with a grin and disappeared through the archway with a giggle.

Her dad Genic squatted down and hid behind the island, reaching out and slammed open a hidden door, finding the objects and reached inside and grabbed a few items. He stood upright and placed a set of cold water bottles on top of the marble surface. The marble surface showed dozens of perfectly formed rings, coming from a set of previously spilled beverages or sweaty bottles of water, staining the porous surface of yesterday years of dead folks.

I reached and touched the cold water bottle, turning with a frown to see the wall. Behind that wall, there was an assortment of dead bodies. I quickly removed my hand, shivering in creepy weirdness and coldness.

Henoana exited from the last room and jogged ahead over the marble floor back to her husband, stopping and stood, hitting marble surface with both palms, staring down at the water bottles.

Genic pointed down with a smile and a nod to the floor. "There's a built-in refrigerator underneath this table surface with a set of numerous bottles of beverages of water but no snacks, dear."

Segue exited the room and dashed back to the marble island and reached out, grabbing a bottle of water between his mom and his granny, pivoting back to his selected room with a yell and a grin. "There's a race car bed in orangey-red wood inside this room with four wooden wheels and a plastic round steering wheel. My room. My room. My room..." He clomped on a pair of cowboy boots down the hallway as a song of classical music of harps and pianos echoed throughout the hallway.

Henoana smiled with a nod and thumbed back over a collar bone down the hallway. "The marble has a beautiful shimmery unique appearance like no other surface that I have seen before with the whirling patterns of white and tan shading coupled with the tiny sprinkles of gold.

"Each bed room suite is colored in a set of different shades of light green, pink, orange, yellow, red, black, white, navy blue, chocolate brown, dark purple. You can pick from a French king's bed frame, a four post bed frame, a canopy bed frame, platform bed frame, a sleigh bed, or another different bed frame. The wooden bed frames come in white birch, black walnut, orange beech, dark red cherry wood, yellow chestnut, light brown elm, tan hickory, rich violet black streaky markings, honey colored pine, or orange-reddish teak wood.

"Each bed room suite is fifteen feet long by fifteen feet wide with a fifteen feet ceiling. The bed mattress is a king-sized model, sleeping four adults easily. I would say that the suite can hold hundred people in crowded comfort. There are separate bathroom facilities at the end of the marble hallway. Little girls on your left and little boys on your right with a horizontal mirror, six standing shower booths, ten toilet stalls with doors, and two..."

The golden tinted entrance doors parted inward and opened.

Henoana lifted a hand to her throat with a gasp and stared at the rows of floating dresses, coming from the outer hallway.

I turned with a gasp to see the haunting vision too. Each dress hung inside a hovering closet rack which was controlled by a Regulator that was hid behind the clothing items.

The two racks of clothes halted and hovered, slowly landing down on a pair of metal claw feet. The two Regulators back stepped from the two racks of clothes into the outer hallway in silence.

The golden tinted entranced door slowly closed shut.

Henoana scooted around the marble island and approached one of the two racks on the extreme right first, stopping and standing in front of the clothes.

Laddie exited out of her selected bedroom and turned with a gasp, skipping down the hallway to the rack of clothes with a smile and a hum. "Pretty dress. Pretty dress. Do I get to dress in a pretty party dress, Mommy? I don't bring no clothes. Can I wear one please? I like the yellow one." She stopped and stood in front of the rack, reaching up and pulled down on the tea length dress, matching her height and her weight proportions.

Henoana reached down and removed the child's hands from the pretty dress with a sour frown. "Don't Laddie. Let me grab it for you, please." She reached up and retrieved the yellow dress, handing it to Laddie. "Go and take it into your room. I'll be there in a moment." Laddie swung around with a smile and moved forward, dragging the dress over the floor toward her selected bedroom. Henoana shifted and grinded a hanger one at a time over the metal rack with a sour frown and a matching tone. "What do we do next here in Zulu Time, Igala?"

Genic sipped on the water bottle, dropping it back down onto the island surface with a tiny splash, turning with a smile and a nod to see his wife. "We wait for Ucal. We don't need to get fancy here. He will come and led us back home."

I spun around to see the entrance doors and my mom, reading my com-d, moving toward the rack of clothes, since I knew that Ucal was not coming to our rescue. I stopped in the middle of the floor and read out loud the information to my parents. "This is the Cee Building that holds all the Cee chamber rooms. Okay. The Zulu Time Ball is the next step in the Zulu Time process. The ball is a dinner and dance event, where all the parties come together."

"That accounts for no food or no eating chairs in our cold hearted slumbering suites," Henoana shifted and grinded each hanger over the rack with a sour frown for a proper dress to attend the dinner and dance.

I read out loud from my com-d. "We are to select a ball gown. The clothing racks are based on the latest body measurements which were punched into the Society database last month as required by the Society law from all households. Now, we know why we got free medical examinations and shots." I shook my curls with the new information.

Henoana stopped at the purple gown, looking at the measurement with a sour frown. "What kinda of dance, Igala?"

I read out loud. "It says a formal dance with a formal long gown like a royal ball. One set of racks holds the female attire wardrobe, including a set of matching shoes and a pair of gloves. The other rack is a set of male jackets. O. Get this. The males get to wear their blue jeans and their cowboy boots to the ball dinner and dance thing. They only select a jacket fitting over their shoulders." I looked up with sour frown to see the golden doors. "Man, I wanna wear my jeans. I'm nervous..."

"Igala," Henoana shifted and grinded one hanger at a time over the rack of clothes with a sour frown and a matching tone. "What else is presented on the Zulu Time Ball?"

I looked down with a stern face and a sigh of worry to read my com-d. "Let's see. Everyone has to wear gloves. A southern gentleman doesn't touch a southern belle with a pair of sweaty hands for the dance." I turned and smiled to my dad. "Did you know that, Dad?"

Genic nodded with a smile. "Okay, I guess we go to the ball and the dance for some food first and then Ucal will come and take us home last. My belly's growling now." He reached down and patted his stomach with a smile and a nod.

I looked down with a worried brow and read out loud more information from my com-d. "Males wear a set of colored cotton hand gloves hidden inside a left inner pocket of the dinner jacket. Hmm, this is really weird. It says that we are to decorate our faces. The face is not to appear at the Zulu Time Ball in the natural naked state for ease of public identification. Each dancer must wear the required raccoon eye mask..."

Henoana dropped her mouth with a gasp, turning to see the hallway, jabbing a finger at the rear wall. "Raccoon eyes? There's a taped hand-drawn picture on the reflection mirror of a white face with a set of midnight black eye socket surrounded by brown paint. That's a visual symbol for painting a raccoon-eye mask."

I looked down with a nod and read out loud more information from my com-d. "Okay. Each dancer will yield for a visual inspection by the Regulator, before entering the Zulu Time Ball. The Zulu Time Ball starts precisely at five o'clock for one hour and then we..." I looked up with a worried brow to see my mom's worried eyeballs too, thinking the same mental thought. I exhaled. "Well then, we need to get dressed for our dance. I'm getting hungry also." I faked a smile to my mom, moving ahead to the section of the rack of clothes that matched my height, studying the colors which ranged from a dark purple to a baby pink, reaching and grabbed the first dress, a one pink with ruffles.

Henoana grabbed a dress and reached out, gently tapping the collar bone of Igala with a tight smile, back stepping from the rack of clothes, spinning around and moved down the hallway toward Laddie's selected room.

I back stepped from the rack of clothes and rolled up the ankle-length dress, the pair of elbow-length gloves, and the pair of matching sandals into both arms, without tripping over the hard marble, swiftly moving to the first square archway on the side wall and away from my sister's room for the private time to cry and lament on my short sweet life at seventeen years old. I reached up and slammed the metal door with a naked hand, entering a selected room of black hue and stopped.

I stood at the side of the bed mattress, resting the dress over the pretty bedcover and saw a neatly folded blood red T-shirt. I lifted and touched my com-d, pinging for information with a whisper and a sour frown without upsetting the she-ghosts inside my room. "The Cee team wears a T-shirt of blood red to cover any bleeding injuries. The Vee team dresses in a silvery baby blue T-shirt." I exhaled with word as my mind remembered the two teams on Zulu Time last night. The Cee team brought a vicious dog that killed their enemy completely. "The T-shirt is used in the Bowl. So when does that occur? I don't know. I'm so dumb and stupid for trusting in Ucal. I don't know him but from our shared on-line classes, before we met at Hall. Ugh!" I spun around and sat down on top of the bedcovers with a sad face and a whisper. "Don't cry. Don't panic. Because Ucal ain't going to help, he ain't involved here. I am involved here. This is my problem here, so I need to figure out something to save my life...our lives." I lifted up and touched, pinging on the com-d, reading through more of the Zulu Time rules.

The knock sounded on the metal door.

I jumped off the bed and landed on my boots with a tiny heart attack, looking up with a sour frown to see the closed door.

The door opened.

Henoana peeked around the cracked metal with a smile. "Your ball gown is pretty like you. I know that I don't allow you to wear real re-designer makeup, so you should paint your face first before getting dressed, sweetheart."

"Yes ma'am." I nodded with a stern face as Henoana back stepped from the open archway. The door automatically closed. I moved forward and slammed the metal open with a hand, turning to the side, moving down the long hallway and looked down with a stern face to ping the com-d looking for a solution.

Down the hallway towards the Girl's Bathroom, I entered the correct bathroom at the end of the hallway, scooting around my sister.

The bathroom was a squared shape room of two sides. One side contained a row of individual bathroom stalls for peeing and shitting. The other side contained a long white marble counter with six wash sinks in front of a half mirror for brushing your hair or your teeth. Tucked into each wall corner, there was a basket of numerous items for the face, the hair, and the teeth. Between the bathroom stalls and the wash sinks, the wall contained rows of clean hand and face towels.

Laddie danced in front of the first wash sink and the long counter, lifting up each item with all fingers with a smile and a nod. "I wanna a green stone and a red stone and a blue stone and a yellow stone in my hair, Mommy."

Henoana stood behind her daughter and fiddled with the hair of Laddie with a smile. "Already, baby girl, stand still for me. I'm going to pin your hair in an old fashioned bun which will be seen behind your neck and then glue the stones around your skull. How's that, Laddie?"

"Okay," Laddie stood in front of the mirror with a smile and a pair of raccoon-eyes. Her raccoon-eyes showed an elongated V-shape black colored pattern, starting at one earlobe, going across both eye sockets, and ending at the other earlobe. The V-shaped pattern was outlined in brown colored makeup foundation.

I stopped and turned to face the mirror, seeing a tone of fresh pale skin on a clean face, reaching over and grabbed a wet paint brush of black color from the paint stand in front of the mirror.

Henoana finished the hair bun for Laddie and smiled at Igala inside the mirror. "Do you want your hair pinned too with the tacky cheap gem stones, Igala?" She lifted both hands from the child's hair with a smile and a nod. "Go back and find your selected room, Laddie. I'll be there in a moment to help you get ready inside the pretty dress."

"No ma'am." I turned and studied the paper drawing on the mirror.

"Okay." Laddie turned with a grin and a hum, skipping out the bathroom and down the hallway.

Henoana had finished painting her own set of black colored raccoon-eyes on a face of ugly brown makeup foundation too, saying into the mirror to Igala with a smile. "I was worried at first about Zulu Time, but I do believe in your father. He said that Ucal will get us out of this, so Ucal will get us out of this dangerous situation. So this will be a fun night of wild adventure inside a limo and a plate of free food. I don't have order the robot around and clean the dishes. However, you are permanently grounded from driving your car to Hall. You will not wear colors in your hair or on your face, until I am happy again." She turned and moved out the bathroom, advancing down the hallway to help Laddie with her dress and then her proper attire for the dance and the dinner.

"Yes ma'am." I placed the wet paint bush on a face, starting and finished the raccoon-eyes alone inside the bathroom, staring at a silly face and felt sick to my stomach from the word exchange with my mom. She believed that Ucal would come to the rescue of our family.

I exhaled with a puff of dread. I couldn't tell her and my dad the truth. I was too nervous with my own raw emotions to explain the issue, so I would not bother to decorate my long straight black hair that fell down over a back spine. I looked down with a worried brow to ping my com-d for more information on Zulu Time. I spun around from the wet sinks and counter with a stern face and slowly moved out the bathroom, strolling down the hallway.

Laddie passed Igala and entered the bathroom for a look-see, twirling around in her new pretty yellow dress, humming a new song.

I slowly read my com-d, moving down the hallway and stopped in front of the closed door, reaching and slapping the door with a palm on my private chamber room. The bedroom door opened.

I turned with a sour frown and entered the room, moving and stood in front of the bed mattress. I could not find anything valuable information on Zulu Time to plead my justification case. I removed my clothing and rested my pair of ripped and faded blue jeans and my dirty and smelly T-shirt over the bedspread with my boots on top of the marble, reaching over for the pretty ankle-length dress. I dropped it down to the floor and lifted it up and over my hips and my breasts without smearing the black colored raccoon-eyes that itched on my dry face with a sigh of worry and wiggled the rest of the gown over my body, zipping it closed.

I reached over and touched my faded jeans with a smile and stared at new red T-shirt with a worried brow.

A thousand thoughts raced through my mind. I should be practicing the exact words to defend my family as a defense strategy within Zulu Time at seven pm. I should go and hug each family member goodbye. I should call all my friends and save good bye too.

I grabbed the pair of pink colored elbow-length gloves, slipping them over both shaky arms, breathing deeply.

The weird knock on the metal disturbed my nightmare again.

The bedroom door opened.

Genic moved ahead and stood inside the archway with a smile and a pair of black colored raccoon-eyes, wearing a silly colored mint green jacket over a pair of faded non-re-designer blue jeans and a pair of polished red and brown cowboy boots. "It's close to five pm, the start of the dinner and the dance. Our personal Regulator escort is here. He or she or it said to leave all personal possessions inside the room like a com-d. You can place it on the bed. I'm not worried about thievery here." He chuckled with a nod. "This is so thrilling to be on the other side of Zulu Time for the one night, without the dire consequences. Let's go and eat, Igala."

I extended and placed my com-d over the neat bedspread, swinging around and slipped on the pair of matching pink sandals, moving ahead toward my dad with a worried brow. "Dad, what are we going to say inside Zulu Time at seven tonight? We won't have much time before we're required to enter Zulu Time."

Genic reached out and gently patted the gloved arm of Igala naked arm with a wink and a smile. "You're pretty in that party dress, maybe you can keep it. It is a re-designer, good quality. And Ucal knows what to do. I trust Ucal. Let's go and eat, enjoying a good hoe down and ending a long day, sweetheart." He back stepped and spun around to face the open entrance doors, leaving Igala and grabbed, cuddling his wife into his chest.

Henoana wore an ankle-length electric blue dress, a pair of matching gloves and a set of sandals. Then he and Henoana moved forward on the silly mint green sleeve of her husband.

Oltole followed behind the back spines of Genic and Henoana in an old fashioned high collar beige dress, holding the hands of Segue and Laddie.

I exhaled with a puff of nerves and followed the long dress trains and the silly pastel colored coat tails of my family members through the archway and into the cold hallway of more dead bodies. I wrapped both gloved arms around a shivering body, looking down with a worried brow at the pretty white marble floor, breathing with puffs of deep breathes, before I puked over the floor.

The two-person Regulator team turned the wall corner and shuffled down a different hallway of wood flooring. The new hallway was another enclosed space of solid dark wood paneling on the ceilings, the side walls, and the floor without a single piece of pretty art work on the wall or a viewing window of either a tree or a flower.

My new high heeled pink colored sandals didn't tap over the soft material, feeling the dress train catch on the tiny splinters from the old foot imprints of the other dead and buried people here inside the Cee Building. I shivered in creepy coldness and depressed dread.

The Regulator team of two turned the wall corner again, moving ahead toward a set of closed double doors and stopped. Each Regulator grabbed a door handle, moving backward and opened a door, revealing a grand room with a musical song of soft music.

Zulu Time Ball

05:05 pm (late afternoon)

Hot temperatures and partly cloudy with sunshine

Dance floor setting

I stopped and stood inside the archway of the wooden building alone as a Regulator bumped into the pink colored dress ruffles, quietly signaling for criminal Igala to move out of the way and into the dance room. The dance room was large and filled with an assortment of dancing couples, laughing people, and good smelling food.

The twin sisters Jackie and Jaime Jones stood in the middle of the dance room, twirling around in a tight circle in a long gown with a hand microphone and a smile, saying in unison. "Welcome to the Zulu Time Ball."

Jackie stopped the twirl and smiled at the different raccoon-eyeballs. "The purpose is both a ritual of tradition and a celebration of life with our family and friends all present here tonight."

Jaime stopped the whirl and smiled at the different raccoon-eyeballs too. "Please, everyone come and partake of the delicious food and elegant music. I personally enjoy waltzing with a lemon twist of hip shaking rock and roll music later tonight," smiling.

Then a gong sounded with a deep bong.

The crowd of people invaded the dance floor and the both side walls of long food tables.

Genic moved ahead and led his family toward a wall corner with a set of two empty side by side long sofas, sitting down and staring out into the crowd of dancing and laughing attendees, tapping his shoe to the musical beat with a smile and a nod. Laddie and Segue joined their parents on the same sofa, sitting next to one parent. Genic wanted to enjoy the happy scene before attacking the food tables. He patted the kneecap of Segue and leaned over with a whisper into the face of his wife with a smile and a nod.

Genic and Henoana continued to whsiper and stared into the crowd of dancers.

I moved behind the back spines of my dad and my mom, sitting on top of the second sofa with my grandmother, observing the happy folks and felt sick and nervous of the upcoming Zulu Time thing at seven pm, which was in fifty-one minutes and three seconds.

A young male moved ahead from the food table and approached the second sofa inside the wall corner, stopping and blocking the view of Igala, nicely bowing at a fit waist directly in front of her, extending a pink colored glove for a social dance.

I exhaled with a sour frown. I was really not in the mood or the mind set to dance to a happy-frappy song. I faced Zulu Time in fifty-minutes and fifty-two seconds. I didn't care what my dad said or what my dad thought. We were the Cee team, the criminal team within Zulu Time, because I had plowed my ancient car into the newer hover car.

Ucal was only a teenager like Igala. Ucal didn't perform any magic trick by paying coin for the damaged vehicle, exempting her family unit from the Zulu Time deadly consequences.

Her biological partners were being totally dense idiots with the published Zulu Time rules, while Igala realized that Ucal wasn't present at the Zulu Time Ball either. He was lounging comfortably inside his home with his parents like my best friend Minki inside her home as they probably waited for the horror of Zulu Time.

I was in the middle of the horror picture show, holding back my tears of sadness of my upcoming death.

The young unknown male continued to bow down to the pretty teenager girl like a poor peasant with a smile and a rumble of baritone timber. "Miss, can you do me the delightful honor of accompanying my lead in this joyous song for a dance?"

I frowned at his silly pink glove. "No."

He did not know my true identify, criminal of the Cee team. I didn't have extra time to read the entire instructions of the Zulu Time Ball, but I bet that our raccoon eyeballs were painted for that specific purpose.

He smiled with a set of silly black colored raccoon eye sockets too, wrinkling around his blue eyeballs. "Miss, you are quite beautifully stubborn. Please dance the first song with me."

"No." I didn't desire attention, feeling uncomfortable and seriously worried about my upcoming death.

Oltole leaned and elbowed Igala with a grin and a whisper. "Good on, sweetheart. Have some fun for a little while. It'll make you feel better and also relieve some penned up tension and stressful pressure of this awful night. I believe in your father. Ucal will come through too."

I frowned at his glove again. "No. It reminds me that tonight..." I held back my tears and my set of disturbed emotions as an unstable teen at the moment.

Oltole frowned with a whisper. "Hush, girl. Dance with the young man. Enjoy your last footsteps on the planet. We don't know what tonight will really bring, child."

I nodded with a sour frown. "Yes ma'am." I exhaled with a puff of annoyance and stood upright from the sofa as my plantation dress expanded and bounced against his pair of ripped and torn non-re-designer blue jeans.

The male chuckled and back stepped from the pretty dress ruffles, extending a pink gloved hand to the girl.

I reached and grabbed his glove, moving forward from the sofa, bouncing side to side inside the extra-wide dress, since I was not used to wearing fancy expensive re-designer clothing.

They moved ahead and scooted over a crowded dance floor and away from her family.

The male spun around to see Igala and led the dance waltz, clamping both a cupped hand around her wrist and her arm. He pulled her closer into his chest as they slowly swayed side to side with the classical music. He smiled with the silly raccoon-eyes.

I exhaled and inhaled, holding back my tears of sadness. I wanted to escape from the Zulu Time Ball, him, my parents, and everything. In forty-nine minutes and thirty-three seconds, I would face Zulu Time as a criminal of the Cee team. I stumbled forward. He caught her arm, pulling her into his chest. I faked a smile of fresh breath. "I'm sorry. I'm..."

He smiled with a set of good teeth. "Nervous. That's okay. I'm nervous too. This is my first time at the Zulu Time Ball."

"First time..." I looked down with a puzzled brow to see a matching pink colored sporting jacket, a pair of ripped and torn non-re-designer blue jeans, and a pair of polished cowboy boots and pulled back with a gasp and a sour frown to see his silly raccoon eyes. "I do recognize those polished pair of aqua and black cowboy boots. Ucal..."

"Shh." He reached and placed his fingers over her lips with a nice smile. "We aren't allowed to exchange names, gorgeous."

I frowned with annoyance, excitement, and worry. "Ucal..."

He leaned into her nose bridge with a stern face and a whisper. "No names. Call me, sweetheart. I call you, darling." He pulled back with a smile and a nod.

My hands sweated inside the pair of elbow-length pink gloves with a fluttering heart. "U...sweetheart, why are you here at the Society Ball too?"

Ucal frowned. "Darling, I and my family are part of the Zulu Time Ball." Igala stopped with her danced steps and jerked both gloves from his body with a sour frown as Ucal grabbed out and reached each wrist, replacing her arms around his fit waist, swaying side to side with a smile. "Dance is the movement of shoes and breasts, rhythmically." He chuckled and cuddled her.

"Why you here, U...sweetheart? My dad said..."

"Darling, I promise I will explain my family unit's presence here tomorrow in Hall after Zulu Time." Ucal smiled with a nod.

I pulled back in angry. "I might not be here tomorrow. This is..."

Ucal pulled her into his chest with a smile and a whisper. "Dance, we have to dance." He cut his raccoon covered eyelids to a set of posed and posted Regulators around the walls of room with a fake smile. "I don't want us to get caught not dancing."

"U...sweetheart..." I frowned.

He smiled. "Darling, the real purpose of the Zulu Time Ball is to locate and identity your opponent, the Vee team, while they are trying to locate and identify all of your family members too. It is an old fashion war strategy, probably from the olden medieval days of King Arthur, when his brave knights eat like barbarians at these long picnic tables with the enemy. Then a knight cut an enemy's head for burping or farting," chuckling. She grinned. "Made you laugh in death? Remember? We had to watch and write a report on that video tape at home during history session. Here, the enemy is dressed like a princess or a prince with a funny looking pair of black raccoon eyelids. Every face wears a set of black circles around each eye socket and brown face paint to the earlobes. The paint's making my face itchy, thou. Every girl wears a fancy pretty dress. You're really pretty, darling. And every guy has a sissy pastel colored jacket with a set of fake battle medals for drama underneath a pair of good ole blue jeans. I didn't think that you would've recognized my old boots. I polished them good, spit shine and all."

I felt safe in the arms of Ucal with a smile. "They're pretty, too, sweetheart."

"The Regulator commands the Zulu Time Ball. So every person here is a professional dancer, mixing in with the visiting Cee and Vee teams. The entire ball is faked to prevent the Vee team from identifying the Cee team before Zulu Time."

"Why? What for? I know the Vee team. Okay, I do not. I didn't meet the driver of the hover car. You did."

Ucal swung around in a circle and danced with her in the same circle. "It is another historical war battle strategy presented by General Jackson Stonewall in the Civil War of the year of 1863. He would hold numerous social dances in the South at his cotton plantation right before the outbreak of war, sizing up the enemy, learning the enemy's personality, and thinking with the same mental mind set. Have you ever heard the term 'know your enemy?'"

"Yeah, yes, I do. Is that the game play tonight?"

"So, narrow your eyelashes, cautiously and carefully, and look around the walls, the wooden floor, and the food tables, the professional dancer or dance unit is having a great merry time. They eat, drink, chat, and joke with smiling faces and full bellies. The fighters, they are not eating, drinking but whisper talking while bumping faces into each other skulls, guessing their enemy." Ucal said as they swayed side to side with the soft music.

I narrowed my eyelashes, turning to see the food and beverage tables on the side wall. I studied each person from the right to the left, a head nod, a hand fling, and a lip movement. Each person smiled, laughed, or ate a food item from the table. I couldn't eat or drink or think. My inner guts were flip flopping with tons of nervous energy. I was afraid that if I ate one crumb of bread, then it would come back up as puke green vomit on the dance floor.

Every person was dressed in a princess gown or a battle jacket. Every person wore a pair of raccoon eyes while some males displayed facial beards or goatees or cat whiskers. The females were all princesses with a face of glittering foundation powder of pink, yellow, white, brown, or black as the head of hair was covered in an array of tiny gem stones of diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, rubies, and other semi-precious jewels.

The wall corner housed three beautiful couples, waving their arms, swaying their skirt tails, and tapping their heels with fun. I arched a neck, straining to see the extreme side of the room. A semi-line of elderly couples chatted with a set of giggles and laughs with other happy faces.

"Darling." Ucal smiled.

I scanned the room as my eyeballs landed on my parents.

Henoana and Genic were huddled together like a pair of love birds, looking into each other eyeballs within the silly pair of raccoon-eyes, tapping each other arms with a laugh.

Oltole sat with Laddie and Segue, patting on their body parts, hugging their skulls with smile and a nod of happiness, not worry.

"Darling, the enemy is at three o'clock." He chuckled. "Maybe, three-thirty using the old war battle time. Their fancy dance shoes are against the wall paneling in a semi-circle, whispering to each other. And they're very..."

"Short." I turned with a gasp and a giggle to the person on the far wall.

"The family name is Chen, probably Asian DNA. These folks have a set of short legs and arms but quick body reflexes. Ya gotta watch their little feet and their wiggling fingers..."

I turned and sneered into the nose bridge of Ucal. "Don't! Stop! Why are you telling and tattling me all this information to me?"

Ucal smiled. "To help you win, darling. I really greatly desire that you don't lose, gorgeous."

I exhaled. "My dad said that you would help us win too. And that's nice and helpful, sweetheart. But this is cheating..."

"...cheating death. You're dang right about that one, gorgeous." Ucal smiled and twirled her around the floor in the same spot.

"I..." was afraid of dying.

"You're too nervous and excited to think straight. I would be too. And this is the purpose of the Zulu Time Ball." He looked over her collar bone to see her granny. "Your granny is doing the same thing as me. She can't see with her old eyeballs that good from inside a far wall corner of a large dance floor as she entertains her grandchildren. I'm not cheating against the Chen family. I'm aiding my friend from childhood. There's nothing wrong with saving your life, darling."

"I..." choked on my tears.

"You don't have to mention all your learned secrets. You pretend too that you observed this and that also. First, get with your granny. She's a smart old bird. She probably has figured out the enemy too but just needs some confirmation."

"I..." was so grateful. I leaned over and hugged him, holding back my tears of pain, angry, fear, and fright.

"The Zulu Time Ball, in the beginning, held an introduction gathering, not a pleasant social like this, but a viciously violent entanglement. The very first opponents of the Cee and Vee teams actually started fighting with a pair of twirling fists, drawing blood from the flesh and the bone and then cutting up each other throats, literally with a pair of hunting knifes. The first Cee team was a bunch of low-life thugs in the city, attacking the grandmother of Jane Jones. The Cee and Vee teams met as instructed by the idiotic people representatives and then the two opposing family units just started beating the tar and shit out of each other. The female people representative who initiated the first Zulu Time and her entire family died right here on this very spot."

I looked down with a puzzled brow to seek a set of blood stains within the dark polished wood. "She died here."

"Long time ago, in the year 2060, this was the old US Federal Government courthouse in the city of ancient someplace. The courthouse was place that was used to determine guilt or innocence of a man or a woman by a human judge. That's why the adjacent building is decorated in pretty marble. The white marble is hard, smooth, and pretty like you, darling." He smiled. "The marble symbolizes the justice of the old courthouse structure. Therefore, the entire floor, the walls, and ceiling are all white marble with a set of tiny golden specks of paint chips. In comparison, the Vee building is pink tinted marble with a set of tiny specks of silver paint chips."

"And both buildings contain the dead bodies of Zulu Time."

"Right again, darling. Do you know the ending of the first Zulu Time?"

"I don't."

"Well, you can guess the ending of the first Zulu Time."

"I can't."

"The first Zulu Time ended with the entire immediate and extended family unit of Jane Jones fighting and battling against three different families of each accused criminal. After the blood, guts, and gory, one man was left standing."

"Who?"

"Well, it was really two children, not a single man. Her twin nine-year-old granddaughters were covered in red blood, pink guts, and white bone fragments." He chuckled.

I turned with a worried brow to see my baby brother, who was nine years old too. I couldn't image him covered in red blood, pink guts, and white bone fragments from a fist fight to save his life.

"Jane Jones is the inspiration of Zulu Time, just and justice. The Zulu Time was created and blessed by the representatives of the people. Then the old corrupt and greedy people representatives each got a butthole herded into a Zulu Time playing field too. By the year 2059, folks were sick to death of high taxes and holy corruption. So the folks created a Regulator. The Regulator started investigating into lies, corruption, and thievery. One by one, a criminal surfaced and then the criminal was allowed take his punishment of instant die or take a chance of life inside Zulu Time."

"Wait." I lifted a glove hand with a puzzled brow.

Ucal reached and grabbed her glove, pulling Igala into his chest with a whsiper. "Shh. We're supposed to be dancing, not conspiring, darling. Just whisper your question into my ear while your luscious breasts tickle my jacket."

"Sweet-tart."

"Sweet-heart."

"Sweet-tart." I frowned.

He pulled back with a smile and a chuckle. "O sweet-tart." He pulled her closer to dance.

I smirked with a giggle from all my newly accumulated knowledge from my com-d and my cute teen-hunk dancer. "Sweet-tart, if I understand you correctly from that brilliant history lesson of Zulu Time, then I can option out of Zulu Time, somehow. Therefore, I can take my punishment for the car accident."

Ucal parted his lips with a whisper. "Yes, you can. I can't believe that I didn't think of that for you."

I smirked and twirled him around the dance as the smarter teen. "Why should you, sweet-tart? I crashed my vehicle into the other car."

"I was there too. I paid for the car damages."

"U...sweetheart, please, tell me that you're not in trouble for doing that?"

"No. I was being a friend, looking more like a dope. The teen accepted my coin but he didn't explain it to his father that you hit their vehicle which opened up the Zulu Time invitation."

"I don't understand."

"Ya keep repeating that sentence, darling?"

"I'm afraid and don't understand the concept of Zulu Time. I'm not a criminal. I didn't mean to hit the bumper of the vehicle. It was an accident. You saw the accident."

"You're right on every argument. Zulu Time has become more..."

"May I please have the next dance, beauty?" A new tall male stood and bad breathed into the nose profile of Ucal. Ucal turned and sneered into the raccoon-eyes of the unknown male, releasing Igala without arousing suspicion from the row of Regulators against the far wall.

"Yes, of course, I would be very honored, sir." I turned and nodded with a fake smile as a southern belle, not desiring to un-mask Ucal's secretive role in my Zulu Time aid and back stepped from Ucal. I faked a smile and curtsied on my curved ankles at the young male. Ucal didn't yield his dancing pose, snarling into new male's face.

The male was not intimated, lifting and shoving his lavender glove into the pink jacket of Ucal with a nice thrust of gravity force, pushing Ucal from Igala. The male posed an arm at the two o'clock pose and the nine eight o'clock pose in the air, a waltz position for the new music.

I placed a glove into each cupped palm of the unknown teen male.

The teen male pulled her into his chest and then curled both his arms around her waist with a sissy giggle. He didn't wait on the music, swaying their bodies side to side in a slow steady motion as the fanfare peaked into a high chord of violin strings. He shifted and moved into the middle of the floor with the other laughing dance couples.

I smiled. "I do declare that I recognize that girly snigger of Dfee."

"Dwit, Dfun, Dfit, and Dfee, that's me." He smiled.

"Do you know the identity of my previous dance escort?"

"Yeah, I know that redneck, too. Ucal and I have been peeing on each other boot toes, since we were three. Then, my mom saw us do that nasty thing in my back yard and whipped my naked butt with a long dogwood tree branch. That particular branch is thin but firm on tender un-tanned flesh."

"Dfee, are you a professional dancer, too?"

"The redneck's been tattling. Yeah, my family unit's part of this dang Society dookie, too."

"You sound un-impressed."

His eyeballs darted to the wall for the people. "Did he gave you the low-down on the...your enemy?"

"We found the enemy at three-thirty of the wall clock on your left." I watched Dfee.

He scanned the wall and located the enemy with a smile and a laugh. "They're short."

I smiled. "Ucal remembered the family name is Chen, probably some type of Asian ancestry."

He swung her around into a different spot over the dance floor with a sour frown. "Ucal?"

I said. "Shh. He says that we're not supposed to exchange names."

"Yeah, but this is personal and private and pissing my off to all three space stations orbiting the Pluto. How does that redneck know how to ID the Vee team? He ain't blood kin to them, is he? That's how some folks find who is fighting with who..."

"Whom?"

"Whatever. When a Regulator discovers some leaked datum exchange from either a Cee or Vee team, then the sneaky snaky leaky family members become involved in Zulu Time. So how does the redneck know, beauty?"

I liked to hear the sweet endearment from cute and feisty Dfee, feeling happiness during a moment of worry. Ucal used an endearment and spoke the word at the end of each sentence with the word, gorgeous, like he couldn't remember a girl's name. I smiled at his sweet endearment of beauty, feeling much better with my bold solution. "He witnessed my car accident that brought me here into Zulu Time." Dfee stopped swaying, dropping open a mouth. I jerked both his arms over my body, moving the cute teen-stud closer to my fresh breath and my fake smile. "Don't reaction."

He closed a mouth with a whisper. "Dwit, Dfit, Dfun, Dfee, that's me, beauty." He pulled her into his lavender jacket without smiling. "I don't like your ruffles. I can't get you close to me."

I gasped. "We're dancing, not conspiring.

"I'm not conspiring. I'm trying to mate with you, beauty." He laughed. She shoved him from the ruffles of her dress with a sneer. Dfee pulled her back into his jacket with a stern face. "Shh! No horseplay. The robots get suspicious and then you get landed into the Bowl."

I frowned. "What bowl, a fruit of apples? I have one on top of the kitchen counter at home."

He frowned with a whisper. "I'm shocked since we're boyhood friends. I'm shocked that I didn't know that particular fairy tale, beauty."

"He didn't think it a big deal. Why would you think it a bigger deal?"

"It's not. I mean it's controlled. I mean I'm shocked. That's all."

"Join my Zombie Club, boy."

"Look, the short folks didn't stand up to your tallness, beauty. The tallest kid is no taller than my baby sister. You win just slap a skull against a ton of limestone rocks and then..."

I gasped. "Wait. You're talking about that Bowl thing with the homemade weapons..."

"Yeah, it is the best chance to survive from a car accident that you caused..."

"No, I don't wanna win like that. I don't wanna fight. I don't wanna harm."

"I don't wanna dress in his silly sissy lavender jacket either. But I do obey my mom. And I do believe that your mom wants you to live for another day. And I do, too, beauty." He smiled.

"And I have a new strategy."

He frowned. "Suck ratty guts..."

I smiled. "Call me, sugar."

He frowned. "Sugar, there is not a suck ratty guts plot here. You go to Zulu Time or you go to..."

I frowned. "Do not say it. My heart can't take it. I don't wanna see..."

"You won't, beauty." He smiled.

I smiled. "I know that. I opt out of Zulu Time. And I accept the punishment of wrecking another person's car like in ancient year of 2018. Then the guilt party which is me and my parents pay all the coins to repair the damage of the wrecked property, the Vee team's family hover car."

"But! That? Well, I didn't know that shared information. How did you figure that out, sugar?"

"The redneck told me."

He chuckled. "Well, that son of gun's really smart..."

"Smarthole..." Ucal stood and bad breathed into the eardrum of Dfee with a sneer and a sour frown. "The song's done, boy. Move off the babe. It's my time to dance with her gorgeousness."

I stood between two teen bad asses, not wanting any uninvited attention of my shared secret and my shared friends, saying with a growl. "You and you behave, now. I don't need all the added eyeball media attention to...to my pink ruffles."

Ucal leaned over with a sneer into the eardrum of Dfee. "No attention. Since the rebel's leaving now."

Dfee back stepped with a sour frown and a sigh from Igala, "Yeah."

Ucal scooted in place of Dfee, reaching and placing a pair of gloved hands around her wrist and lifted her off the flooring, dancing in a half-circle in the air with a chuckle and landed her back down onto the floor with a smile, scooting Igala into his face with a whisper. "I have more information..."

"I..." started to talk.

He shook his shoulder length strawberry blonde colored curls. "No. This is the last dance music for the Zulu Time Ball tonight. Then you go back into your Regulator hole. You must absolutely present your person before seven pm in front of the Regulator. The Regulator on duty must hear this from your lips, the opt-out clause. Do you remember entering the Cee Building?" She nodded in silence. He said. "There was an intersection with a right or a left foot path. You turn to the right and head toward the end of the hallway. The Regulator is housed there."

"The doors are locked."

He shook his curls. "No, nothing is locked down or sealed up or guarded here. Go into the Regulator's office before seven pm. Seven is the start of Zulu Time. If it were me, then I would be there at 6:45 pm and then surprise the hell out of the Regulator, before they gather and come to the Cee chamber rooms for you and your family," chuckling.

I said with seriousness. "I should go right after I leave here at 6:10 or 6:15 or 6:20 to ensure the Regulator sees and hears me, before Zulu Time begins."

"No." He turned and viewed the dancers. "Everyone's leaving, walking back to their vehicles or socializing with each other, before they head off to their homes for the show. All the Regulators are outside as work guards for this reason, since both the Cee and Vee teams are inside and unaware of each other. A Regulator could interpret your solo act as an escape and then..."

"Understood."

"And no one can know that I told you this secret information, darling."

"Never, I promise, swearing on my soul."

Ucal smiled with a nod. "Hit the wood at 6:45 and march your body right into that room. No one is every denied access to the Regulator. Then you shout out loud: I am the criminal. I caused the car accident and want punishment of wrecking the car, not Zulu Time. Once you select that alternative, the Regulator will be forced to conduct a personal and private investigation into the car accident."

"That means..." I must pay for the damage to a very expensive hover car. But the alternative of life is better than the alternative of death.

"And you must wear your jeans and that silly facial girly makeup of symbols, not that fancy dress."

"What?" I gasped.

"No fancy dress or sandals. You must appear like your regular teen selfie that caused a silly car accident without purpose or bodily harm to another human being. Get it?"

"Got it." I nodded with a worried brow.

Then the gong sounded with a deep dong.

Jamie and Jackie twirled around and around from the wall, moving and occupying the middle of the dance floor with a hand microphone and a smile, saying in unison. "Ladies and gentlemen, the Zulu Time Ball has concluded. Thank you for coming out to attend the nightly event. Please drive home safely. Have a good trip. Good night."

Ucal back stepped from Igala with a grin. Igala felt the cold whirlwinds of air around her body, being absent of his hotness. He bowed at a fit wrist as a southern gentleman and then stood upright without a smile. Since, they didn't know each other, just dancing, not conspiring, darling. Ucal back pedaled further as Igala back stepped from him, not showing any emotion or smile. Since, they were only dancing, not conspiring, darling.

Igala back pedaled further into a dancer and moved forward from the butt-collision as Ucal back stepped into a dancer too. They halted with a smile and a pair of dancing eyeballs to see each other and started back pedaling again.

I smiled without a glove wave, straining my two eyeballs to see the silly raccoon face on Ucal. Then I felt the warm hand on a naked collar bone.

Oltole stood behind the back spine of her granddaughter and whispered into the eardrum of Igala, watching the unknown male teen. "Do you know that young gentleman, Igala?"

I watched a pink tuxedo jacket cuddle next a lavender one, knowing that I had two nice friends, maybe one naughty boyfriend. They slammed each other back spines with a pair of hands, bumping foreheads and turned, strolling toward the exit door from the dance hall.

Ucal looked back over a collar bone to see Igala for the final look-see. Then he and Dfee went into the darkness of the hallway.

I smirked. "No, Granny. He was a nice dancer that told me stuff, making me smile for a little while."

"That's nice, child." Oltole patted the collar bone of Igala.

Henoana pulled away from husband's side with a stern face and moved beside Igala, extending and touched a gloved hand on the other collar bone of Igala, shoving them to the other archway and followed the Regulator team back into the Cee building. She said with a serious tone into the eardrum of Igala. "We're to follow the Regulator guards back to our chamber. Igala, did you see Ucal? Did you speak with him? Isn't he required to talk to one of our Regulators about our delicate manner?"

I stared ahead at the two back spines of each Regulator that was escorting the criminals and then turned to see each Regulator on the wall that was guarding the wall. There were a lot of Regulators present here inside the dance hall.

Genic hugged his son Segue and his daughter Laddie with a smile and a nod, leading his family back down the creepy but pretty hallway of marble, following behind the back spine of the two Regulator guards.

I did not show any type of facial or body language, saying with a stern face. "No, Mom. We just patiently wait. Then Ucal will arrive." Since I had to locate, find, and beg the Regulator into stopping the death sentence of my family unit while looking like my teen self. My parents were fit people, but my younger brother and sister could not fight inside the Bowl with another teenager equal or greater than my body size, if somehow that option played out tonight at seven p.m.

I had a tough solution from Ucal. Now, I had to figure out how to sneak out of our Cee chamber suite of ice cold rooms, looking like my teen self, without a set of nosy questions from my parents before seven pm.

The Regulators turned the wall corner and another wall corner, marching over the smooth marble floor, stopping in front of the two golden tinted doors of the Cee chamber suite of rooms.

Genic, Segue and Laddie stopped and waited for the doors.

I slowly and halted beside my mom and my grandmother, observing.

The golden doors automatically opened without any type of mechanic or an electronic ray from one of the lenses of the sunglasses or a finger tip of the golden glove of the Regulator. Therefore, I wasn't permanently locked inside the Cee chamber suite of rooms until Zulu Time at seven pm.

06:09 pm (early evening)

Cee chamber suite of rooms setting

Smith family

The Regulators split and moved backward into each side wall, creating another set of two angel shadow figures. The Smith family moved ahead into the cold and pretty chamber suite and stopped in front of the marble island in the middle of hallway, waiting for a miracle from their oldest daughter and sibling.

Henoana reached out and touched each set of hair roots of her younger children with a smile. "Laddie and Segue, go and run and play inside your selected bedrooms while we figure out the exact time to leave."

"Sure." Segue nodded with smile, turning and running back into his selected room.

"Okay." Laddie dashed ahead with a smile and a nod, running behind her brother, moving back into her selected room, skipping over the marble and turned, disappearing from eyesight.

I swiftly parted from my mom and my grandmother, swishing my gown over the floor in the direction of my selected room, removing one glove and slammed the annoying door open with a sweaty palm. I entered and moved to the nice bed mattress and stopped, standing in place. I reached out and grabbed my com-d, slowly spun around to the door and pinged on the tiny screen, reading more information on Zulu Time. I bumped my hair roots into the closed door and back stepped with a soft curse, reaching and slamming it open with the same sweaty palm.

The door opened.

I swished forward in the dress, looking down with a worried brow at the com-d, reading the Zulu Time information and stopped, standing in front of the front of the island and removed my other glove. I left the gloves on top of the island. Her adult family members stood around the square shaped marble stone island like a table, staring at the black colored hair roots of Igala. I continued to look down with a worried brow and touched, pinging on my com-d, wasting time on the clock before my escape from the chamber suite of rooms to find a Regulator, saving the lives of my family.

Henoana stared at the black colored hair roots of Igala with a smile. "What is the next step of Zulu Time, Igala?"

"I'm checking on that now." I exhaled and pinged on my com-d, wasting my time before my escape from the chamber suite of rooms to find a Regulator and plead for the lives of my family.

Genic nodded with a smile to the hair roots of Igala too. "Well, we finished the dance and the dinner. The food was very, very good. My stomach's full. When is Ucal coming? I don't wanna be asleep and miss him. I wanna shake his hand and thank him for his help."

I pretended to read more Zulu Time instructions with a fake smile of worry, without viewing each face of my relatives around the island. "Okay. The next step of Zulu Time, I'm guessing here, since Ucal probably has to follow a certain set of rules too like us. Ya know?"

Her parents possessed an individual com-d also but were so happy to see the truth here.

Oltole reached down and picked at the lace collar of her ankle-length dress with a smile and a nod at the hair roots of Igala also. "Your guesses have been very good, child."

"Thanks, Granny." I pinged and pretended to read the Zulu Time rules. "Uh, it states here. Okay. I will paraphrase. Okay. Ucal is like our chosen Cee team representation in Zulu Time, since..."

Genic nodded with a smile to see each face and the hair roots of Igala. "He executed the coin transaction with the driver of the automobile that you smashed with the Old Girl."

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance, looking at my com-d. "Yeah, the automobile, I smashed on the guard bumper. Ucal paid for the monetary damage for me."

Henoana turned and nodded to her husband. "I believe that Ucal should be paid from Igala's tiny coin account that was funded by some birthday funds over the past years. How much was the coins, Igala?"

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance with their silly questions as I wasted time before my escape to find a regulator to save their lives, staring down with a worried brow and a worried heart at my com-d. If I looked up, I might start crying or yelling at my relatives from the dangerous situation and my delicate emotions. "I don't exactly know, Mom. I can ask Ucal tomorrow at Hall. I promise to tell him that I will pay for his generosity." The com-d time was 6:17 p.m. I pretended to read Zulu Time rules and wasted more time on the com-d before my escape to find a Regulator to save the lives of my family. "Ucal is like our chosen representative Cee team representative of Zulu Time and he must meet with the Regulator..."

"That makes perfect sense. What will Ucal say to the Regulator?" Genic turned and nodded with a smile to see each face and the hair roots of Igala.

I pretended to read the com-d with a worried brow and a set of fluttering butterflies inside my tummy. "He will explain what he saw and what he did. Ya know the crash and the cash?" I actually cracked a smile to the com-d while hearing a throat clear from my mom. "So I do not believe that we will see Ucal before that event. Since Ucal will be standing and waiting for the Regulator to..."

"That's interesting." Genic frowned. "I understand that you don't have to wait on a Regulator. They are always available to hear from every person in every Society City."

I continued to look down at my com-d with an annoyed brow, fidgeting inside my dress with the pretended lie. "Well, they hosted the Zulu Time Ball, tonight. I saw tons of them inside the room and outside the hallway, helping to direct the good citizens. I would think that they have some obligations and commitments of shutting it down the dance and the dinner. Am I not correct here?"

Henoana nodded with a smile. "I believe so too. So we wait right here for Ucal."

I pretended to read my com-d with a worried brow. "Yeah, we wait right here for Ucal."

Genic slapped both hands over the silly mint green jacket with a smile and a nod. "And in the meantime, I believe we should get out of our borrowed clothes and change back to our clothes. Then when Ucal arrives, you know with the good news of our departure, then we all can be ready to go back home. And we can sleep in our own bedrooms tonight."

I dropped open a mouth and looked up with a gasp, nodding with a smile. "Excellent suggestion, Dad. Great idea, Dad. I agree with your analysis, assessment, and conclusion. I wanna get outta this fluffy dress too." Ucal told me that I had to present my usual innocent teen selfie in front of the Regulator. I was wondering how to get out of the evening dress without permission from my parents. Now, my dad had solved the answer for me. So I would change into my blue jeans and wait a few minutes before the 6:45 pm deadline and then escape from the chamber suite of rooms to find a Regulator, saving their lives. Then my family would return back home safe and sound.

Oltole nodded with a smile. "My clothes are inside the first bedroom over there behind me."

"Yeah, my stuff's inside the first bedroom on the left." I pointed with a grin to the first square archway on the left. Each bedroom was perpendicular to the center hallway. I had accidentally selected the first bedroom for an upcoming to escape from my parents to find a Regulator and save their lives, without passing beside their selected bedroom which was down the center hallway.

Henoana shook her curls with a stern face and a serious tone. "I don't know, Genic. I think that we should remain in our present and pretty stated image. Remember? On the glass screen at home, all the team members wore a set of formal clothing. I don't want to upset the Regulator into thinking that we are breaking the Zulu Time rules. Or we are so arrogant to walk away from Zulu Time without a fight. So we stand dressed in our fine clothing. When Ucal arrives to save us, we can change and go home." She nodded with a smile to each family member.

I dropped and closed my mouth, feeling the two thousand and one butterflies into my tummy with nervousness and fear.

Genic slapped both hands over the jacket with a frown. "Yeah, we should not break any rules until Ucal comes and gives us permission. But we can remove the raccoon eyes, right, dear?"

Laddie exited from the room, turning to face the entrance doors, running down the hallway and slammed into her mom with a grin and a giggle. "I wanna bounce up and on my bed more. Can I? Can I?"

Henoana reached out and placed both hands over the collar bone of Laddie with a smile and nod. "Yes, we can remove our raccoon eyes. The powder makes my skin itch. And we can remove all the gems and the ribbons from our hair too. Come on, Laddie. We must remove these gem warts that I've glued all over your face. You look like you have a case of gem measles, since the gem stones are all different colors and textures." She turned and shoved Laddie down the hallway to the Girl's Bathroom.

Segue returned from his selected room and stood in front the marble island with a smile. "I wanna..."

Genic reached out and grabbed the shoulders of his son with a grin and a chuckle. "Let's go and wash off the raccoon eyes, Segue."

"Naw, I like the raccoon eyes. I wanna where my mask home and show my friend Rugard." Segue shook his head with a sissy whine, covering a face with both hands. "No."

"Yes, it's girly makeup. And I don't want it over our furniture." Genic shoved his son down the hallway toward the Boy's Bathroom.

I looked down to see another second of time for my escape to find a regulator and save the lives of my family, fidgeting side to side in place and gasped with a whisper. "I gotta remove the raccoon eyes too." The time on the com-d read 6:22 pm.

Oltole leaned over and hugged Igala with a smile. "You're so brave, Igala. You did nothing wrong. I'm just glad that Ucal was there for us. He also did his good deed for the day," she didn't release her grandmother Igala, continuing to nod and smile.

I faked a smile with an upset stomach as my legs shook from fear of a lie. "Yes, he did." I needed to move from the island and my grandmother, removing the raccoon eyes foundation and dress in my old ripped and torn non-re-designer blue jeans. I pulled away from here with a fake smile.

She smiled to Igala. "I'll be lying down, child. Please tell your mom and dad, if they are looking for me.

"Shore, I will, Granny." I nodded with a fake smile, pulling from her hand gripe. The time on my com-d read 6:24 pm.

"This evening is too much for me and my old heart." Oltole turned away from the island and slowly moved ahead in the pretty old fashioned beige ankle-length gown toward the first archway on the opposite side wall.

"All right, Granny." I back stepped from the marble island, lifting up my ankle-length dress and ran down the hallway, passing my mom and my sister and hit the bathroom archway. I stumbled over the long dress toward the last sink and around the standing water puddles from my sister's water playtime, since the room temperature air was cold and dry inside the chamber suite of criminals. I held the com-d between ten fingers, my world of seeing communication, which would not ruin with tons of water.

A com-d was water proof. But I was not taking a chance now.

The time read 6:28 pm.

I reached out and clicked on the facet of water and rested my com-d in the far corner, looking up with a gasp to see my face. The raccoon eyes were beautiful on my flawless pale tinted complexion.

Society provided nothing but prettiness and properness. Everyone knew their single standard role, a re-designer of something, such-like, a moving car, a cooking appliance, a working robot, an entertaining glass screen, a piece of clothing, and even an old damaged human body part, if you possessed tons of coins.

Everyone was equal in our perfect world with no crime, no corruption, and no creativity.

I reached down and wet my hands, grabbing the soap, rubbing the water over the hard substance and produced a hand of bubbles. I leaned down into the sink, lifting and rubbing my soapy hands over the raccoon eyes. The soap stung my eyes. But I didn't care. I still had a new problem, getting out of my evening gown for my escape to fine a Regulator and saving my family before seven pm.

I rubbed the soap around a dirty face with a set of closed eyelashes and rinsed off my hands, splashing the pure water over a soapy face. My face felt clean and dry. I lifted my face to see a tone of red colored skin. I didn't care. I gasped with fear. I needed to paint my face like a silly innocent teen for my presentation to the regulator at 6:45 pm.

Presently, all the teens and the children had fun decorating a cheekbone or a bicep with a silly paint job that moved and sounded with a musical note or a nasty growl or a sweet whistle or a loud bell. All the girl teens did it to attract a guy. All the pre-teens did it to annoy a parent.

My face dripped and drained a set of water droplets down my chin, over my dress, and onto the sink counter. I didn't care. I reached out and grabbed one of the towels on the wall hangers, lifting and rubbing my face clean and heard.

Henoana and Laddie were approaching down the hallway and into the boy's bathroom.

I dropped the dirty towel inside the wet sink and turned with a gasp.

Henoana had moved inside the bathroom. She and Laddie stood at the first sink of water. Henoana was pulling out and off each ugly wart like a gem stone from the face of her baby daughter. Laddie screamed with wails and tears. "Aw. That hurts, Mommy."

"You have a set of thick yellowish patches of hard glue on your face underneath each gem stone. I have to remove the glue first. Or your face will freeze, darling?"

"Freeze?" Laddie gasped with fear.

"Like a popsicle then you'll look funny." Henoana smiled.

Laddie frowned. "I don't want to look funny. I wanna look beauty like you, Mommy."

"And you shall be beautiful, again, sweetie." Henoana grinned.

I lifted up my dress and moved forward on a sandal and stopped with a gasp.

Henoana fiddled with the hair of Laddie with a sour frown. "Igala, come over here and help me with her hair. She has a set of ribbons that need to be unwrapped..."

I gasped. "I can't."

Henoana frowned and fiddled with the hair of Laddie. "Why not?"

"I have to pee." I swung around and faced one of the bathroom stalls, feeling nervous. When I became nervous, I needed to pee. I lifted up my dress, banging both my kneecaps into the open door, bumping both my elbows with the gathered dress and entered the tiny stall and turned, dropping down my girly panties and sat down on the toilet with a worried brow.

Henoana yelled. _"Igala, where are your manners, tonight? I do not want to hear that language every again."_

Henoana rubbed a wet cloth over the raccoon makeup as Laddie screamed. _"Stop. Let me. Mommy. No soap on my face. Stop."_

"Yes ma'am." I yelled and released my bladder at the same time, standing and re-dressed, swinging around and flushed the toilet, slamming opened the stall door with my buttocks, turning around. I moved to the same wet sink, clicking on the water and washed my hands, looking up to see a pale tinted face without a smile. Then I reached and grabbed the com-d.

The time read 6:30 pm.

Henoana turned with a smile and then a gasp. "O no."

I turned and moved forward to the bathroom archway with a sour frown. "What?"

"You...you are covered in dirty water on that beautiful re-designer dress."

I stopped and waved both wet hands and my com-d in the air with a stern face. "It don't matter."

She turned with a sour frown and pulled on the gem stone from the face of Laddie. "It does matter. You clean it right now."

"I don't have..."

"We have plenty of time, Igala."

"Ucal is coming..."

"And that dress betta be cleaned before Ucal and the Regulator arrives. Or I will be using your tiny coin account to pay for that expensive re-designer dress. We work with a set of re-generator jobs to pay for all our things, young lady. We can't afford the excellent things in our home."

"Fine, fine," I swung around and grabbed a clean towel from the horizontal rack, turning with a gasp and stopped. I needed a set of colored powder for my teen face design to appear in front of the Regulator as a normal innocent teenager of no wrong doing. I leaned over the sink and clicked the water on with my elbow, getting the towel wet and reached down, stealing a pack of orange colored powder for my face. I leaned back and clicked the water off with my elbow, holding the powder inside the wet towel and turned to bathroom archway.

She frowned and picked out the ribbons in Laddie's blacked colored hair. "Where are you going, Igala? Why are you acting so strange tonight?"

I moved forward with a smile. "I'm going to clean the dress in my room. I am excited and nervous about all this."

Henoana pulled out the ribbons from the hair of Laddie with a stern face. "Do it in here."

I stopped and gasped. "Uh...I have to remove the dress and expose myself. I don't wanna..."

"All right, hurry with cleaning that dress, before Ucal and the Regulator arrive. I promise. You will be purchasing that dress with your tiny coin account."

"Yes ma'am." I dashed out the bathroom with a worried brow of limited time of the clock and my life. If I didn't escape now and find a Regulator, then I was a dead teen. I swiftly trotted by the Boy's Bathroom and heard. Segue was arguing with a set of flinging arms and a tongue of mouth spat with his dad for keeping the black colored raccoon eyes.

I looked down with a worried brow to see my com-d. The time read 6:36 pm.

I lifted the dress up to my kneecaps and ran down the hallway, slamming into the metal door with a grunt and a soft curse and back stepped, slamming a clean hand into the door.

The bedroom door opened.

I tumbled inside and stopped beside the bed.

The bedroom closed automatically.

Pretending I was changing my clothes, since I was a teen, taking my girly sweet tea time with everything.

I dropped one of the shoulder sleeves down from dress and halted with a whisper. "O no. I can't do that. When I return from the Regulator office, I will be found without the pretty dress and inside my old blue jeans. Ugh. Death is so complicated." I reached out and grabbed my blue jeans, dropping them over the floor, sliding them underneath the dress as I danced side to side with a set of new steps. I reached out and grabbed my dirty T-shirt, unzipping the bodice of the gown down to my waistline, wiggling the T-shirt over my chest and then I jerked the pink gown over my T-shirt too. I would ditch the re-designer dress in the wall corner of the hallway before entering the office of the Regulator.

My sleeves showed through the dress.

I exhaled with panic, stretching and pulling down each sleeve into the off-the-shoulder dress. "I should be smarter, not stupid. Ugh. Get in there, girls." I placed my com-d over my wrist like a normal nice teen without any wrong doing.

The time read 6:37 pm.

"Go now." I spun around from the bed mattress and moved ahead over the floor, tumbling in the pair of unfamiliar high heels sandals with a gasp. "I need my cowgirl boots, not the high heels. No teen wears sandals with a pair of blue jeans." I dropped down on the floor, feeling the fluffy of the thick dress over my buttocks and lifted one leg and removed the sandal, replacing with a cowgirl boot on two feet. I stood with a grunt. I had forgotten a pair of thick socks. "Get blisters and live to see the sunrise, tomorrow, Igala." I spun around and moved to the bed, straightening the bedcovers sorta good, since my mom would get suspicious that I was not cleaning my dress but sleeping on the job and touched the neatly folded Zulu Time red colored T-shirt with a gasp.

I posed, mentally thinking of Ucal's words: Don't get caught outside the doors. The Regulator won't understand.

Then I back stepped with a puff of nervousness and smoothed down my pretty gown with a practiced southern belle giggle and a grin. "I'm lost, Mr. Regulator, sir." I looked down at my wrist com-d with a gasp.

The time was 6:39 pm.

I spun around from the bed and dashed ahead to the door, slamming the metal.

The bedroom door opened.

I looked back over a collar bone to see the hallway. Clear. I narrowed my eyeballs to see the bathroom archways. Clear. My face turned to see closed entrance doors with a smile. Beautiful. I lifted the dress up to my kneecaps, exposing the blue jeans and dashed away from my bedroom toward the entrance doors, hearing.

"Igala..."

I stopped and dropped the dress over my blue jeans, slowly swinging around with a fake smile and a set of gritted teeth to see my granny.

Oltole stood in the middle of hallway with a confused brow, thumbing back over a collar bone. "Where is the powder room, dear? There is not a refresher facility inside my room, child?"

I lifted and jabbed a finger to the rear wall of the long hallway. "Down at the end of the hallway, Granny."

She frowned. "Where are you going, child?"

I shook my curls and both arms in the air like a wild teen. "Nowhere! Nowhere! I...I wanted to see the rack of dresses, pretty re-designer dresses. We can't afford them, ya know?"

"All right." She slowly spun around with a stern face and more slowly moved down the long hallway. "I am going to the powder room, if you mom or your dad is looking for me."

I spun around with a worried brow and moved ahead toward the rack of clothing, running into the stationary rack stand and back stepped with a soft curse, twisting my neck to see her waddle down the long hallway. I could hear my siblings yelling and crying with the rough removal process of the girly makeup inside each bathroom. I turned to face the golden doors with a smile, dashing ahead, running into the glittering golden metal and hit my nose bridge and halted.

The entrance doors did not open

My body heat didn't activate the electronic sensor. I whispered in panic. "No. Open. Open. Now. Now." I swiftly back pedaled with a stern face and slowly side stepped, standing in the middle part of the door and paced forward like a regular sane person to one of the closed golden doors. I looked back over a collar bone to see the hallway. Clear. I narrowed my eyeballs to see the bathroom archways. Clear. My face turned to see the doors. Beautiful.

The door parted and opened at the same time, revealing an empty hallway without a Regulator.

I lifted the dress up to my kneecaps, running down the middle of the marble, avoiding my body reflection against the burning urns of fire and tripped over the gown and fell down on the floor into a pile of thick ruffles in pain and panic, "Dang."

I looked down to see my com-d. The time was 6:42 pm.

The entrance doors closed in silence.

I struggled to stand and jerked the dress up to my waistline, since I wore a pair of blue jeans underneath the dress and ran down the end of the two creepy white walls of dead people and over the pretty smooth marble floor. The coldness of the floor slapped against my warm and sweaty naked feet inside my boots without a pair of socks. I saw the double entrance doors and turned to the right as instructed by Ucal without stopping and huffed down a new empty corridor colored in white marble too, without a Regulator sighting too. I smiled with my new upcoming surprise.

A second set of metal doors appeared down the end of the marble hallway.

I slowed and halted, scanning the white walls.

Ucal said the office of the Regulator was embedded in the old part of the courthouse which was made of dark tree wood. I had read this on my com-d. This was the new part of the Cee Building, the morgue entrance for the dead Cee team members.

"Ugh. The other right..." I back stepped and spun around, lifting the dress to up my kneecaps and ran in the opposite direction, passing again the set of closed double entrance door and the open entrance hallway into the chamber suite of ice cold rooms, where my relatives were doing something.

The floor material changed from pretty marble into smooth wood.

I slowed my pace and breathed heavy, lifting and wiggling out of the re-designer dress from my body, smelling the sweat of both underarm pits and tossed the dress from a face as it hit the floor. I tugged and dragged the dress behind my butthole, fiddling with one hand down into the tight pocket of my jeans for the orange powder. I lifted and shouldered the dress over a collar bone. I couldn't leave it exposed over the wooden floor, since a Regulator might find it and me. I reached and lifted the pack of powder, opening the lid and dunked two fingers into the dry substance, swishing them around. I raised and placed the two fingers on my right cheekbone, smearing downward, painting two sets of straight lines like two stabbing arrows of death and lifted my hand as the orange powder drifted in the air waves and dropped, glowing pretty over the wooden floor.

I reached down and dunked the same two fingers again into the soft powder, lifting and smearing the other cheekbone with the same two orange colored straight lines like two shooting arrows in fury for an innocent teen-look. I reached down and dunked the same two fingers into the powder one more time, lifting and smearing a set of two straight lines across a naked forehead with a sneer of victory. I bet that I looked cute like an innocent teen now.

I advanced forward to a solid wooden wall. I remembered walking down this way to the dance and dinner Zulu Time Ball.

I turned and faced a set of closed double wooden doors, running with a nod and a smile, tossing the re-designer dress into the darken corner wall and halted. I breathed heavy with both fright and fantasy. I was meeting a Regulator in person twice in my life and hopefully the last time.

My heart echoed within both eardrums while my tummy flip flopped with one thousand and one butterflies as I halted and grabbed the twin door handles and jerked forward with all my strength.

The doors did not open.

I gasped with worry, jerking forward on one door without opening, lifting both arms in worry and twirled in a half circle with a gasp and a sour frown to see a second set of wooden double doors in the opposite distance of the same hallway. "The other, other right..." I ran and leaned down, swooping up the dress with one hand and semi-stood, dashing to a set of double doors at the opposite end of the corridor and halted, tossing the re-designer gown into the dark corner. I looked down to see my com-d on my waist like an innocent teen.

The time turned into the numbers 6:45 pm.

Ucal said to enter at 6:45 pm.

I looked up with a stern face and reached, touching both the door handles with a pair of two sweaty and orange colored hands and pulled, easing it backward. My hands were sweaty. My heart pounded. My knees shook.

The double doors opened in silence.

I slipped in-between a tiny crack of the heavy wood.

A Regulator sat behind a long wooden table, watching a tiny glass screen without hearing the new visitor.

I coughed and crocked with tons of nervousness, advancing down a parted section of smooth wooden aisle between rows of wooden pews like an old fashioned courthouse with a smile and a nod, waving both arms like a silly innocent teen. "Hi. Hello there, sir." The Regulator looked up and turned with a stern coppery golden face to see Igala. I stopped and waved both arms with a smile like an innocent teen. "Uh, hey, I'm Igala, ma'am. I'm from Family Smith. I guess we're called the Cee team." The Regulator did not stand or speak. I stood in place and continued to wave both arms with a smile. "I was told that I could come here and talk. So, here, I stand. I wanna say. I am the criminal. I caused the car accident. I request Option of paying with coin for my punishment, not Zulu Time."

The Regulator droned in a monotone alto timber with a stern coppery golden colored face. "Accepted."

I didn't want Ucal in trouble either, dropping and ringing both orange stained hands with nervousness in front of my T-shirt with a stern face and a serious tone. "And Regulator sir, the driver of the other damaged vehicle was paid with coin at the location cite of my car accident too. Therefore, I have met the punishment requirements, too. But I and my family will do what is required of us per the code of our Society City Four, Miss Regulator."

The Regulator droned in a monotone alto timber with a stern coppery golden colored face. "Indeed."

"Well, I guess that's it." I back stepped and waved both arms like a silly innocent teen of no wrong doing. "And I and family will be leaving now from you, the building, and Zulu Time. Okay? Bye. Nice meeting you." I hit and slapped the heavy door with my boot heel with a giggle and a grunt.

The Regulator droned. "Good day, Igala of Family Smith."

I reached behind the space of the door and my back spine, searching for a door handle and found one, shoving it open with my body and stumbled backward with force and fell down on my buttocks over the hard floor with a giggle.

The heavy door slowly closed and hid my silly teen accident.

I stood upright and spun around with a smile, swooping up the dress with one hand, dashing back down the hallway toward the intersection point with a giggle. I turned the wall corner and lifted, dropping the fancy dress over my hair roots, wiggling side to side in blindness into the wall, the other wall, and over the floor, almost tripping as the dress shimmed down and completed covered my regular teen clothes. I lifted the dress up to my kneecaps and raised and rubbed my face with a naked forearm, cleaning off the orange powder, without a set of nosy questions from my parents, dashing over the wooden floor and exposed my kneecaps again.

I turned the second wall corner and hit the marble floor, lifting the dress up to my waistline, swiftly racing down the long hallway with a fluttering heart and a racing pulse. I didn't want my parents to find me missing inside the Cee chamber rooms.

I looked down between the fluttering dress ruffles of the pink fabric to see my com-d.

The time read 6:48 pm.

The Regulator would be coming to collect both the Cee team and the Vee team for the Zulu Time program at precisely 6:50 pm. I had read that inside the Zulu Time rules.

I slowed and then halted, breathing heavy, sweating balls of stink and activated the sensor on the entrance doors.

The glittering golden tinted doors parted and opened at the same time.

I entered into the room and scanned the cold hallway of rooms for my relatives, seeing nothing and turned with a grin to my selected bed room with a flip-flopping stomach. My mind clicked with too much activity.

I slammed the metal with a naked dirty hand, slipping a body in-between the wide air space and rammed my face and my chest into the bed on purpose with a heavy sigh, resting across the soft bedcover with relief. I exhaled and inhaled, slowing down my heart rate, closing my eyelashes.

The door sound with a heavy knock.

I turned and slid down from the bed mattress, plopping down over the floor with a silly grin, covering my face with the black bedspread, wiping off more of the orange makeup, without a set of nosy questions of wrong doing from my parents as an innocent teen.

The door opened.

Henoana peeked around the crack with a smile, opening the door, standing in the archway. "Igala, we have received some very good news without Ucal coming into our suite. The Regulator just came inside our suite and said that we have been pardoned or something. What are you doing on the floor, girl?"

I dropped the bedspread with a silly grin and a giggle.

She gasped. "Why's your face red colored?"

I reached and touched my dry skin with a silly grin. "The raccoon eye makeup itched on my face. I was scratching it, Mom."

She frowned. "Get up, Igala. We're leaving from here and going back home now..."

I stood as the dress caught on part of my blue jeans.

She gasped. "What are you wearing underneath that expense re-designer dress?"

I lifted a leg and showed off one of my cowgirl boots and one leg of my ripped blue jeans with a grin and a giggle. "I...I am getting...got dressed in my clothes over...underneath the re-designer gown. So...so I can flip it out and leave from..."

She frowned. "What?"

Genic stood in the hallway with a smile and a shout in front of the open entrance doors. " _Henoana, let's go. I wanna outta of here, now."_

"Change your clothes now and then come out and get into the limo. Hurry!" She spun around and moved back to her husband.

The bedroom door slowly closed.

"Yes ma'am." I stood in place, lifting the gown and reached down, grabbing the orange colored powder from the pocket of my jeans and tossed it backward over my hair roots and into the air. The powder hit the black bedcover without harm. I wiggled my hips as the dress bellowed around my legs. Then I skipped ahead with a grin and a giggle to the closing door, catching the metal and swung the door open. I ran over the floor and through the open archway of the Cee chamber suite of rooms.

The marble hallway was quiet and empty as the Smith family advanced ahead over the smooth hard floor, without a whisper.

I lifted the dress to my waist and raced down the hallway, catching up with the back spines of my family. There were two rows of standing-at-attention glittering coppery golden colored Regulators, creating a section of air space between the double doors and a limousine on the city street for the Smith family.

I dashed ahead through the open entrance door without stopping and followed my family into the grounded limousine.

Inside the interior hallway in the Cee building within the courthouse building, Ucal stood inside a dark hallway with a soft chuckle and a nod, parking both hands over the belt loops of his blue jeans.

A tall Regulator pulled up beside him even in height with a stern face of coppery gold, staring at each back spine of the Smith Family, saying with a monotone baritone timber. "I wonder who could have informed that young miss about the rule of Option inside Zulu Time."

Ucal watched Igala and her family exit the building with a smirk and a nod of silence.

A short Regulator pulled up and scooted beside Ucal, saying with a monotone of alto timber with a stern face of coppery gold too. "All the Zulu Time rules are publicly displayed for any reading by any citizen at any time in any com-d."

The twin entrance doors closed, blocking out the bright stars and the cool night breeze.

Ucal smiled with a nod. "The citizens don't enjoy reading about Zulu Time. They enjoy watching Zulu Time."

The short Regulator droned. "There seems to be one citizen smarter than the rest." She turned and nodded to the nose profile of Ucal. "Would you agree, Ucal?"

"Yeah," He back stepped with a smile and a nod from the twin Regulators, spun around with a chuckle, moving through the courthouse building, going back to his home for the night.

07:07 pm (early evening)

Warm temperatures and bright red, yellow, and blue sunset

Limousine ride of the Smith family

I leaned down and slid over the soft leather seat of the limousine with a set of three compartments, the cab for the driver, a single bench for the children, and two opposite benches for the adults. Segue and Laddie were watching a video game inside the second compartment which was sound proof as the glass screen played for their entertainment back home.

Genic sat across from his wife and beside his mother with a nod and a smile, slapping both hands on a pair of faded blue jeans. "Ucal came through. He arranged our freedom from Zulu Time."

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance, looking down with an annoyed brow and ruffled my dress with a soft whisper to my relatives inside the enclosed cabin. "Yeah, Dad! Ucal came through."

Henoana turned with a confused brow and stared down at the re-designer dress and the hair roots of Igala. "Why are wearing that dress, Igala?"

I touched my dress with a smile and a nod. "I wanna keep it as a reminder of freedom."

Henoana reached and touched the dress with a sour frown. "Is that legal? Can Igala keep the dress, Genic?"

Genic smiled with a nod to his wife and the hair roots of Igala. "Igala bounced right out that door wearing that fancy expensive re-designer gown. The row of Regulators didn't stop her or ask her questions. But they were wrong to bring us here first. So I guess they decided that she could keep it like parting or party gift second. It's okay, dear."

Oltole sat beside Genic, reaching and pointed up to one of the four mounted tiny glass screens in the wall corner of the limousine cabin with a gasp and a puzzled brow.

I turned with a gasp, seeing the single black colored capital word: Zulu Time. My heart dropped down into my stomach and then further down into my green painted toes. Zulu Time was being continued without our family but with other Cee teams and Vee teams.

The screen wiggled and changed into a row of large and small oval shaped objects, standing against a tan colored rear wall inside the room of Zulu Time.

Inside the Zulu Time Building, Jackie Jones stood beside her sister, without twirling around, wearing a tight fighting coppery golden colored one-piece jumpsuit like one of the Regulators. She said with a sneer and a sour frown into the numerous walls of glass. "The Vee team has lied to the Regulator."

Jaime wore the same outfit, saying each tiny glass screen with the same sneer and sour frown. "Lying to a Regulator is punished by death immediately."

Then each female turned and moved to a side entrance door, spinning around to see the back spines of the Regulators.

Inside the limousine, I gasped with my adult family members. The large and small objects were all the adults and children of the driver of the hover car that I had accidently crunched with my fender into at the Hall grounds, yesterday.

The cameras panned backward to expose the entire tan colored Zulu Time room.

A line of glittery coppery golden colored Regulators stood in front of the cushioned bench, aiming a cold barrel at each Vee team on the forward wall.

The twins growled in unison. "Aim high..."

Then both the side doors closed.

Each Regulator pressed a trigger, releasing an array of bullets as the tan colored tape turned into rich black one each oval object. And then the row of objects wiggled and stilled.

The side doors opened.

Both Jackie and Jaime moved and stood behind the line of Regulator with a sour frown and a sneer in unison each glass screen. "It is done. This concludes our program tonight. Thank you for watching Zulu Time."

Then the four tiny black colored glass screens went black.
282nd day of the year

07:07 am (early morning)

Warm temperatures and partly cloudy with sunshine

Home of Smith family

Breakfast setting

**T** he air condition unit cooled the room in silence as the entire Smith family sat around the dining room table in silence with a set of tiny tings from the utensils and a series of tiny pings from the plates.

Henoana chewed and swallowed, wiping a dirty mouth with the napkin, staring down at the black hair roots of Igala. "I mentioned before that you are grounded from driving the Cadillac, Igala. Your dad will take you to Hall, every morning. I will come and pick you up from Hall, every afternoon. The grounded period is one standard month. You are to be waiting outside the Hall building at the bottom of the stairs in rain or shine, young lady. Then you will come home to study. When I return from work today, I want to know what re-generator job you have selected. This is the purpose of Hall to prepare for your future, Igala. Do you understand the new rules of Henoana?"

"Yes ma'am." I stirred the food without finishing the breakfast meal. I had almost eaten all the delicious food items until she started the lecture again.

Last night, I had received the lecture inside the Zulu Time limousine, through the front door archway of our house, up the staircase, and finally at the door frame of my room. I turned with a sour frown and an angry soul and entered my room without slamming the door shut.

Yeah, I was grounded. Yeah, I rammed into the other car. Yeah, I was guilty. Yeah, I safely left Zulu Time. Yeah, Ucal saved my life. Yeah, Ucal liked me.

Last night, I went to bed with a smile without supper, thinking of both Ucal and Dfee. The two teens were funny, cute, and brave to attend the dance event at Zulu Time. I could never do that for a second time or an afternoon of teen fun. The Zulu Time program was too depressing and dangerous for my teenly deep and mixed emotions.

Segue chewed and swallowed with a smile. "Can I leave and go and do my sessions, Mom?"

"Yes, you are excused, Segue." Henoana stood upright from the table, leaning down, gathering the dirty plates for the teacher robot to wash and clean before the start of Henoana's work day.

Segue slid out the chair and spun around with a grin to see the staircase, lifting and pinged on the com-d into his face. "Rugard, ya up? I went..."

"Segue!" Henoana yelled with a sour frown, holding a dirty plate in each hand.

Segue turned around with a smile. "Yeah..."

"You are never to utter one single spoken syllable of Zulu Time from last night. This is the newest rule. And it is illegal to speak of Zulu Time to other citizens. This is a rule of the Regulator. Therefore, last night has ended. This is a new day. Please, go and perform all your room and homework duties, now." She turned and entered the kitchen with a stern face and a silent prayer that her family was saved from Zulu Time, last night. She was very upset with Igala and wanted a more severe punishment for her daughter. But she mentally thought it over and over again last night inside her bedroom and finally concluded that was a tiny fender bender and Igala had learned a lesson about life and a life with Zulu Time. Thus, Igala would not be driving for a standard month. Then, Henoana would ride inside the passenger seat and watch Igala drive to Hall, after the one month's probation was terminated.

Thank goodness for Ucal. He was a smart boy and would be a good husband and protector over her daughter.

Henoana stopped and stood in front of the sink, leaning down and gently placing the dirty items into the tub and hit the facet.

The water splashed everywhere.

Henoana laughed from the relief of feeling the cool water on her warm hands.

Genic wiped his mouth and stood upright from the chair with smile and a nod, staring down at the black colored hair roots of Igala. "We need to get moving for Hall, Igala, and then me for work. I'll drive you to Hall in the old car and then return and store her inside the garage. That type of vehicle has to be driven every day or the oil was turn into pudding which will ruin the car. Let's go, honey." He spun around from the table and moved toward the front door, sweeping up the car keys from the side table near the entrance foyer of the house.

I stood upright from chair and wiped my face, dropping the napkin back down into my dirty plate. I was not required to perform a series of domestic house chores, since I was required to attend Hall to pass all the tests for a good re-gen job. I back stepped from my chair, pushing it into the table edge, trying to be a good daughter again and spun around with a stern face, running after my dad.

The front door opened with a show of bright sunshine of a pretty day.

I ran through the archway of the open door.

The door didn't close.

"Close the door." Oltole sat at the dining room, finishing her meal.

I halted with a gasp and back pedaled, reaching back and grabbed the door knob, gently closing the door and released it. I ran forward toward the car and halted with a smile.

Genic held the passenger door open for his daughter like a southern gentleman with a smile and a nod.

I slid into the soft leather seat, bouncing up and down with excitement of new day at Hall, actually feeling good about seeing my new friends at Hall, instead of butt-heading with my angry mother for the morning.

He slammed the door and leaned over the dropped window with a smile and a nod to see the nose profile of Igala. "Don't be too mad at your mother. She is a caring mother and loves all her children. She'll cool off in about a week. Then you'll get the car back to drive to Hall. And I should know. I'll be married to her for a long, long time. She was worried, last night. I wasn't worry, thou. Ucal came through like I knew that he would. Ucal can." He turned with a laugh and a smile, moving to the driver's seat.

"Yeah. Ucal can." I looked down with a frown at my blinking com-d device.

Minki was calling again to tattle about a tidbit of some piece juicy of hot gossip about another teen. She wasn't interested in studying for a re-generator job with her one track mind on the body parts of Ucal.

I didn't miss the flirting action with Ucal either. However, Ucal seemed to ignore Minki. And Dfee hated Minki for some reason. And I didn't want to know that reason either. I wrapped an arm around my back spine with the blinking, not beeping com-d, avoiding another lecture from mom this afternoon. My daddy tattle tailed to my mom all the events of the day, without being nosy, just social.

The driver's seat opened with a soft creak.

Genic slid into the seat and cranked the engine. The car purred with power.

The door closed with a loud bang.

He lifted and slammed both hands on the steering wheel with a smile and a nod. "Aw, it has been a long, long, but I think I can handle a rolling machine again. When we stop at Hall, I'll ask if Ucal wants his coin back. Your mother is adamant about paying all our debts to vendors or to teens." He drove with a smile down the private driveway and stopped at the old roadway, looking in both geographical directions first and then turned onto an empty paved roadway with a smile.

Igala and his family were safe and sound for a new day. Last night was not fun but entertaining inside the Zulu Time building, since he understood the goal of Zulu Time. And only a true criminal reported to Zulu Time for a vicious and proper judgment. His family hadn't committed any type of crime, such like, a murder. And Genic added more respect to both Ucal and his family too for aiding in their fun escape from the Cee Building.

08:08 am

Hall Building

Warm temperatures and partly cloudy without sunshine

Parking lot setting

Minki rested a hand on the rough column post of the Hall building, tapping out a steady beat while one of her re-designer shoes tapped on top of the smooth concrete with a different musical off-beat. Her face wore a scowl of disgust, watching the parking lot and spying on Ucal as usual.

Ucal stood upright from his personal hover car as the vertical door automatically dropped and locked down into place, securing the car. He cared about nothing and carried a laugh and a smile, spinning around and slamming into the nostrils of his childhood friend Dfee, slapping the bicep of Dfee with a nod and a grin of something funny. The two buddies didn't move into the Hall building today, standing inside the parking lot, talking with a set of rolling hand flips and nodding chin of smiles.

The other teens parked a transport over the hard pavement and entered the building for the morning assignment of the required wattle and daub painting. Twaddle stood inside the hallway on one of the side walls with a sour frown and a moaning tone, calling all the teens into class as usual.

Minki was dressed in a pair of new re-designer walking shorts of solid black with a single strap of bright pink on each side of her leg with a pair of new black colored re-designer high heeled sandals for the morning wake of the dead inside Zulu Time last night. Her head of long blonde hair down a back spine wiggled in long streaks of rich black and bright pink for the morning wake of the dead inside Zulu Time too. Her distorted face showed a hollow black and pink outlines of tiny angels for the morning wake of the dead inside Zulu Time too as both wings of each tiny angel arched back and forth with a tiny whistle from chewing the piece of bubble gum.

Minki dropped open a mouth without losing the blue colored gum with a gasp of shock.

The four wheeled Cadillac slowly paced over the rough roadway of the grounds and parked underneath the tall trees like the previous two days.

Minki was shocked to see Igala present at Hall today, since Igala and her entire family had been present inside Zulu Time, last night. Minki knew that Igala and her family members were inside Zulu Time campus too, because Minki had tracked down the hover car driver that was involved in the tiny fender bender by means of the satellite video tapes. A person could easily access any stored satellite feed to visually see and repeat a specific recorded scene, if the person knew the date, the time, and one person on the recording.

Then Minki drove to the house of the dented hover car and introduced her person with a smile and a nod, inviting her person into the small house in the eastern part of Society City Four. She followed the teen boy up into his private bedroom, pleasuring him for an hour as his parents remained at work, learning the real story.

Igala had barely scratched the outer rear bumper on the new model hover car, since the newer models flew in vicious hail storms, violent heavy rains, and vile super hurricane winds while tossing twirling buckets load of nasty hard rock and trash items at any outer shell of a hover car.

Ucal had viewed the ugly dent on the front of the ancient car, not the new model hover car and then offered payment at three times any type of standard repair to the young teenager.

The teen of the hover car borrowed one of his parents' vehicles for the required hours of Hall, since his parents had refused to provide a hover car after the successful transport test. He faithful returned back home after Hall to study the re-generator tests for a re-gen job. On the day of the fender bender accident, the teen was flying his mother's car, a new hover model. He was having trouble lifting off and steering the vehicle and then landed down inside an old fashioned paved roadway for a few seconds. And then Igala came around the curved road and hit her rolling vehicle into the rear bumper of his grounded hover car.

That was not the end of the story.

Ucal paid a nice ransom as a clueless and careless teen to the other teen driver of the hover car without seeking guidance from a mature adult or a wiser regulator like he should have done.

When the other teen returned home with a pocket of massive coins inside his personal coin account, he landed and jumped out of the seat, immediately examining the rear bumper, seeing an almost invisible scratch with a pair of naked eyeballs. His parents would be mad about the tiny dent in the new car but madder about the forced ransom of some much coin, without a valid explanation from their teenage son.

So the teen of the hover car reached over and grabbed a standard nail hammer, lifting and beating up the poor rear bumper as the vicious punches provided a good size indentation with a massive amount of ugly scratches into the rear bumper of the new hover car.

When his parents arrived home that evening, he explained the cool lie with the newly creative damage, showing a new fake pot of less coin to cover any type of repair duty. His parents nodded with approval, thus his parents were happy and he was happier.

Minki sneered with jealousy.

Both Ucal and Dfee turned from the Hall Building and dashed toward the parked car of Igala, stopping and standing on the same side of ancient car. Dfee reached out and opened the car door with a smile and a nod, extending a hand also. Igala rose up and exited the car, standing and cuddled between Dfee and Ucal. Then all three, teens leaned down over the metal frame of the open convertible with laughs and smiles to see Genic with fun and sport.

Yeah, Minki could hear the laughter from the carried winds into her eardrums of supersonic hearing.

Now, Minki was mad and dangerous as Igala flirted and touched the body parts of Ucal, the future husband of Minki.

Igala should have died in Zulu Time, last night.

Minki had tattled into the eardrum of the silly boy that the female teen driver of the old ancient car was part of a wealthy family unit, hence the massive amount of coin inside the teen's pot. Then Minki had offered her advice for free.

Then the silly but smart teen had winked and took the free legal advice.

The teen had suggested to his parents that the wealthy family members be presented inside Zulu Time for messing up their new hover car, since it was a teen driver and Igala actually did hit the rear bumper of the hover car. Then the audience of viewers would sympathize and vote for the silly teen and his parents of the hover car as the real victims of a true crime in Society City Four. As the only winners of Zulu Time, the team received all the assets of the dead team members automatically, without hesitation.

Then the teen would give Minki the old ancient Cadillac as part of her wise legal and free service.

The two had formed a union with a wet kiss.

Then Minki left his house before his parents arrived home.

Last night on Zulu Time, the Smith family and the Chen family were brought into the building of Zulu Time and were scheduled to appear in the tan colored room. However, one family appeared on the rear tan wall and taped in the colors of red and tan. Then a row of Regulators killed the row of wiggling tall to short oval shaped objects.

Minki whispered. "So it was the teen and his parents and his other siblings and his elderly grandparents that were killed, last night." She had watched the Zulu Time program while eating supper like always with both her eyeballs and her eardrums. The twins announced on the program that the Vee team had lied and were on display on the wall of death. However, Minki didn't or couldn't believe that, since the physical evidence of coin and cause were overwhelming. She had left the family wall of glass and her warm supper, moving up and into her room, re-playing the accessed satellite recording. There was a satellite feed, Igala hitting the car and Ucal paying with coin for the bumper repair.

Minki exhaled with a puff of annoyance at her brilliant conclusion. "Ah! Ucal had paid for the repair on the spot of the accident like in the historical past of automobile accidents, so the driver wasn't jailed or worse beaten up. I saw it and missed it all at the same time. That's why the kid and his stupid family tree died, last night."

Igala waved with a smile to her father Genic, who was driving the ancient over the roadway back home before he went to his office work. Igala was grounded from driving for a month until her mom was happy also.

Genic waved off, driving and turning the ancient car in a circle for his work.

Ucal and Dfee both swung Igala around with an arm escort to face the Hall building with sets of smiles and chuckles. They marched in a row like a set of silly soldiers, bumping into each other body part with giggles and grunts of fun for the new day session at Hall.

Minki whispered with a nod. "Yeah, I have learned a valuable death lesson, too. And I will not make that mistake again. Watch out, Igala! You're messing with my man." She pirouetted around from the teens with a sneer and a sour frown toward the open door.

Both doors were opened at the double archway.

Twaddle, a middle aged male stood near the doorway with a set of twin bald spots over each eyebrow and a rounded stomach of fat from good food, jabbing a finger with a sour frown and a matching moan going down the hallway. "Go to the classroom, today. Come inside, teens. Go to the classroom, today. Get inside, teens. Class is staring now..."

"Stow it, Twaddle, the waddle." Minki passed with a sneer and moved toward the classroom.

Twaddle turned with a whispered sneer to see the back spine of arrogant Minki. "One day..."

Ucal, Igala, and Dfee moved through the parking lot and marched up the wide staircase with laughs and smiles, shoving on each other for fun.

Twaddle smirked at the playful teen action of the kids. "Get inside, teens. Go to the classroom."

Ucal halted and scooted aside, flipping out an arm into the air with a slight bow of a smile and a fit waist.

Igala enjoyed the treatment as a southern belle, where the lady entered first into a room like a royal princess of yesterday, since all the real royalties were hung by death at the neck muscles within the Rebellion of 2020, where all the people rebelled and rioted from lack of work, lack of money, and lack of food.

Dfee advanced ahead with Igala on his arm and entered hallway with a laugh and a grin.

"Hey, boy!" Ucal turned with a gasp and a sour frown, dashing ahead, slapping a hand over the collar bone of Dfee.

Dfee leaned over with a whisper into her cheekbone, "Hey, girl!"

I smiled. "We got a friend behind..."

Dfee growled. "We got a stalker behind our buttholes. Quick. You run and hide inside. I'm attack the ugly goon, beauty." He released her hand and spun around with a snort, slamming a body into the chest Ucal with a chuckle and a grin.

Ucal wrapped both arms around Dfee with a sneer and a mouth of tongue spit.

I ran ahead to the archway with a giggle and a grin, looking back over a collar bone as the two silly teens fought with loud growls and tongue spit for fun and giggles.

Twaddle stopped with a sigh behind the two dancing immature teen males. "Boys, get inside the classroom. Save the fight for Zulu Time, if you get invited."

"Naw, Mr. Twaddle." Ucal shoved Dfee from a chest with a laugh, scooting around his friend with a smile and a nod. "Me, no get invited. Me, a good citizen of City Four. Me, raised right by my parents." He spun around and moved down the hallway.

Dfee moved ahead with a laugh and a grin, following behind the back spine of his friend down the hallway. "Ucan't go to Zulu Time. Ucan't can't fight. That's funny. Ucan't can't fight. Can you fight? Can Twaddle, the waddle fight? I'll like to see that, bro."

Twaddle moved through the archway and followed behind the back spine of Dfee with a sneer and a whisper. "One day..."

I moved through the archway and stopped, sliding down into the chair next to Minki at the shared table near the wall.

Minki turned and fluttered a set of re-designer red colored false eyelashes on her re-designer foundation face with a grin. "Where's your ancient aqua colored car, Igala?" Her angel wings whistled with a soft tune.

I lifted up and placed my naked hands over the smooth wooden surface with a sad pout. "Bravely alone and frightened like a tiny kitten inside the garage, I'm afraid."

She laughed. "Too bad, the daily forecast is raining cats and dogs on top of you standing underneath the veranda at Hall."

"Zulu Time was boring, last night." Kallidin moved ahead on a pair of purple re-designer heels toward the shared table with her friend Lexedo, slamming her matching re-designer purse with a confused brow over the table surface. "Where were the members of the Cee team in Zulu Time, last night?"

"Ya mean the cowardly hides and kittenly roars of the Cee team?" Minki sneered into the nose profile of Igala.

Ethdamn sat with his friend Keer at the shared table, saying with a shout and a nod. "They were killed before they ever came into Zulu Time. That's why. The Regulators have a spy group to eliminate each and every criminal..."

Ucal shook his skull with a sour frown, sitting at the shared table with Dfee. "No, they don't. Stop fibbing, Ethdamn. Or off with your hover car," laughing.

Dfee shook his curls too with a sour frown. "Not right, Ethdamn. The Vee team was murdered in old fashion execution style with an individual blind fold of red colors. Read your ancient history. I saw that one time before at Zulu Time."

Lexedo asked with a confused brow. "What happened to the Cee team of criminals, Mr. Twaddle?"

Twaddle leaned into the oversized chair with a sigh and a smile inside the wall corner. "This is the reason that we are here inside the classroom, future working adults. When a Regulator judges and then punishes an entire team of the real crime, all the real criminals are killed on the tan wall in Zulu Time. So we do not honor a memory anywhere throughout City Four..."

"That seems so wrong and mean." Lexedo frowned. "They lived here and worked here and died here. They can't help it that they were mean and vile. But they lived here. We should honor their dead memory. In death, everyone's good." She nodded with a smile.

Twaddle nodded with a grin. "This is the code of Society for a Regulator to use and abuse. However, I saw Zulu Time last night, too. And I was wondering about the people on the Cee team also. I do not have an answer to your question, but it's on everyone's mind today. Maybe, we can theorize the plot that unfolded and not before our eyes on the glass screen. Any more crazy and wild teen theories?"

Lexedo nodded with a grin. "The criminals were killed too."

Ethdamn turned and sneered at Lexedo. "The Cee team escaped."

Keer frowned. "Escaped to where? Where does the Cee team go but into Zulu Time? Criminals always will go into Zulu Time, each and every time and then they are punished into Zulu Time, each and every night..."

Ethdamn nodded. "No, they escaped. I heard a long time ago that happened in the year 2068. A Cee team had escaped and then were hunted down like a wild animal and brought back. All the members of the criminal family were publicly executed publicly like last night on Zulu Time. My grandfather told me about it."

Kallidin nodded with a grin. "Last night, the Vee time was all publicly executed by a row of Regulators."

Minki grinned. "I was appalled at the horror of seeing tiny children shot in the face of their little innocent eyeballs from a semi-automatic machine gun by the Regulator."

Ucal turned and sneered to Minki. "O. Did one of your false eyelashes fell off and then drown in your cold beverage from boo-hoo crying, Minki?" He turned with a laugh and a fist bump to his friend Dfee. Both the males detested Minki and her pretend royal teenly manners.

Ethdamn frowned. "Where did all these old fashion weapons come from?"

Ucal pointed with a smile to his buddy. "A concrete underground bunker underneath Dfee's horse barn."

Dfee stood upright from the chair and whipped both arms into the air with a smile and a nod. "Dwit, Dfit, Dfun, Dfee, that's me. And don't no body mess around with my horse barn, ya'll."

Lexedo says. "It would've been much worse, seeing the bullets shot through a naked face and a naked chest. You can see their beating heart along with blown off one or two eyeballs too."

"The Vee team lied to the Regulator." Ucal sneered.

Minki turned with a gasp to see the nose profile of Ucal. "What?" She was extremely suspicious of his knowledge, now.

Dfee nodded with a stern face. "Zulu Time is a fair and just reward system for both the criminal and victim eliminating lies, exhortation, and blackmail."

Kallidin nodded with a smile. "Angry over the politics of the day."

Ucal frowned. "There is not any kind of politicians that out politics here anymore."

Lexedo says. "However, there is a fascination with the winners of Zulu Time. They're heroes, beating out the common criminal."

Ucal frowned. "There are not any winners of Zulu Time, only the rich survivors."

Kallidin nodded with a smile. "There is a growing dissatisfaction among all the working class."

Ucal frowned. "There is not one dissatisfaction emotion among the workers or the working class."

"Or from the Zulu Time winner, that's for shore." Dfee laughed.

Keer frowned. "Everyone works in some type of capacity for coin."

Kallidin touched her long ponytail of highlighted silver and gold in the red colored hair with a smile and a nod. "Society is totally bad against the both pretty teen girls and cute baby toddlers."

Ucal stood upright from the chair and turned to see each teen with a stern face and a serious tone. "Society is not a Fascist Nazi regime from our ancient world history. And Society is not corrupt like the old people representative style the federal government of lawmakers. In the year 2053, we ended the awful wars, the personal violence, and all terminal sickness of a sick body. Now, in the year 2078 all people live to be healthy at hundred years old and longer and then the heart gives out. But yet, there is a rotten apple or two that still lingers on the tree."

"No." Ethdamn shook his skull.

Ucal leaned over with a smile and gently touched the collar bone of his friend Eimeria. "We are the normal healthy and beautiful aristocrats. Perhaps, some of us are kinda rugged." He looked down with wink to Dfee and returned to each face with a stern tone. "But we are overall nice-looking young teens with a set of sincere earnestness and deep convictions of love and life. But some folks still don't wanna be happy at peace with great joy. So I say to all, be great."

"I'm great." Ethdamn laughed.

Dfee chuckled. "I'm greater in bed after joyous sex."

"Call me, Dfee!" Minki turned and waved to the teen.

Lexedo reached and touched the com-d, pinging on it with a smile and a nod. "Dfee, here's my com-d number, coming to ya."

Ucal sneered. "Hush, Dfee."

"Well, I am." Dfee chuckled.

Ucal stared down at the blonde colored hair roots of Dfee. "All the people want to be empty, frustrated, and miserable, so they desire Zulu Time." He looked down with a stern face and pinged on his com-d. A green light emitted and slammed into a blacken wall of glass, showing a rolling Zulu Time event. He looked up with a stern face, pointing to the wall of glass. "In the year 2066, there were not any more criminals within the people population. I'm talking about the colors of white, black, yellow, pink, red, or brown-skinned peoples. Zulu Time got rid of them for us."

"Who is 'us'?" Lexedo frowned at the wall of glass.

"Me and you, Lexedo." Minki smiled at the wall of glass.

Ucal pinged on his com-d again with a stern face and a serious tone. "There aren't any fat people either living in the year 2078, presently. In Zulu Time, a fat male claimed that his personal physician couldn't cure his fatness. Be reasonable, the fat male ate all the time, ate at every meal, including a breakfast, a brunch, a lunch, a supper, a dinner, an evening, and a midnight snack. The fat male couldn't lose weight, so the fat male claimed that the licensed physician was incompetent within the medical practice. The physician and the loving family unit were invited and fought inside Zulu Time as a Cee team of criminals." He turned with a stern face and pointed his com-d on the beige colored wall.

A red colored T-shirt tall slender male physician, standing on top of a wooden platform with a set of wild rock and roll music playing in the background, waved a golden-tinted pick axe above his skull.

Then the pick axe shot down toward a fallen fat male, who rested in a spread-eagle position over a wooden floor.

A silver hatchet freely soared in the air waves and then plunged into the red colored T-shirted on chest cavity of the slender male.

The hatchet split open the chest, exposing a beating heart organ, flooding the stage with red blood, disguising within the red colored T-shirt.

The red colored T-shirt on the tall slender male physician stumbled backward from the impact and disappeared from the wooden stage, falling out of sight of the camera.

A violent horizontal line of yelling and running obese males and females attacked with a set of sharp clean hatches on the remaining three family members of the slender male physician as the arms fell, the heads rolled, and the red blood of the Cee team covered the wooden stage with more body parts.

And the video ended as the wall showed the same dull beige color.

Minki smiled. "I see and you see, too. Inside Zulu Time, we do moral values."

Ucal sneered. "The standard behavior is violence."

Ethdamn frowned. "I don't agree."

Ucal frowned. "The winner of Zulu Time is your imaginative pet dog, begging and pleading to your command."

"Show your proof, man." Dfee frowned.

Ucal thumbed back over a collar bone to the beige wall, where the recording had played. "Finally, the addiction to Zulu Time."

Dfee flipped a hand, missing the naked arm of Ucal with a sour frown. "There isn't an addiction to Zulu Time, bro. Sit down, Ucan't!"

Ucal turned and frowned at the nose profile of his friend. "Bloody violence, vicious battles, hatred bullying. What do you call all of that, bro?"

Dfee stood and raised both arms with a chuckle and a smile. "Free glass. Free entertainment. Free...dumb."

The other teens stood upright from the chairs and cheered with a set of claps and whistles, except for Igala and Ucal.

"Stand down, Dwit!" Twaddle jabbed a finger with a laugh down at the desk surface. "Back to morning and afternoon sessions of Hall, this is your purpose here. In front of me, my teacher desk is filled with a set of extra-large com-ds. This particular com-d unit has all the test questions for all the various jobs throughout Society City Four, such like, a re-designer for clothing, a re-generator for food, and a re-builder for homes when you turn eighteen years old. Please come up and select one unit. You will spend the rest of the day testing your other asset, your brain. At the end of your pretend testing, whether you fail or pass, you may leave Hall for your home. Begin, now!"

I turned with a smile to see the nose profile of Minki. "I'll go and get two of them for me and you."

Minki touched and pinged on her necklace which held her personal com-d with a stern face. "Okay."

I stood from the chair, moving ahead and stood inside the short line of teens.

Dfee slid out from the chair, dashing ahead, slamming into the side of Igala for fun and leaned into her cheekbone with a smile and a chuckle. "Beauty, what are you going to be regenerating for the future?"

"I don't know." I stared with a giggle and a grin at the back spine of the other teen in front of me, feeling the warm minty fresh breath of Dfee on my cheekbone.

Ucal slid out from the chair, moving ahead and stood on the other side of Igala for fun, leaning into her cheekbone with a smile. "You can regenerate with me, anytime, gorgeous."

"I don't know." I smiled with the sudden attention of the two cute teen-hunk males, making my body parts wet and my hormones purr inside my mind.

Minki exhaled with a puff of frustration, re-reading the com-d with the bad news. Her father couldn't purchase another hover car until next year. She looked up with a gasp to see three different back spines and associated buttholes that wiggled side to side with fun. Minki growled with jealousy, looking down with an angry face and pinged on the com-d. "We shall see."

I moved ahead and marched up to the teacher desk with a grin, reaching out, grabbing two com-ds and cuddled them into my breasts with a giggle, turning into the nose profile of Dfee with a smile. "Move, boy!"

"To the right or the left, girl?" Dfee smiled.

I exhaled with a puff of amusement and annoyance, scooting around Dfee, spinning around and moved back to my share table with Minki. I stopped and slid into the chair, reaching out, placing the new con-d over the table surface. "Here ya go, Minki!" I looked down with a stern face to see the oversized com-d, trying to figure out what re-generator job I could pass and then perform for a living within Society City Four. I reached and pinged on the com-d with my Hall session assignments, tapping and reading all the different options.

At 09:09 am, I exhaled with a puff of frustration, gently dropping the heavy com-d over the table surface with a sour frown, leaning over with a grin to see the personal com-d of Minki. "Do you want a beverage? I'm going into the kitchen for a break and a snack and a drink."

Minki worked on the necklace which held her personal com-d. "No."

I frowned with confusion at her personal com-d between her hands. "What are you doing? Why aren't you using one of heavy and oversized and ugly com-ds? What are these silly tall and small symbols?" I gasped with a grin. "Are you going to become a Regulator? Your parents are smart re-gens paying for a good life. That's not the common trend with your biological family. However, I might be intrigued and interested in something new like that, too."

Minki sneered down at her personal com-d. "Regulators do not like people. They destroy people. They regulate Zulu Time. Who in their right mind would dress in coppery gold with a silver eyepiece? It's too ugly. I plan to marry Ucal."

I smiled with a laugh at her blonde and painted hair roots. "Ucal doesn't notice or like you or your re-designer clothing or your re-designer makeup, Minki?"

She looked up with a sneer to see Igala. "But he notices you, so you notice Ucal to notice me instead."

I shook my curls with a smile. "I can't tell Ucal what to do."

"Dfee likes you." She grinned with a giggle.

I laughed with a smile. "Dfee likes any female with a pair of breasts."

She turned and smirked down to her personal com-d glass screen again. "I'm registering to become a hostess of Zulu Time."

I dropped open and closed a mouth. "How can do that? How is that possible?"

"You apply directly to the Zulu Time com-d site. Then you type all your qualifications and then Zulu Time will call and interview you for the job. It's so easy."

I gasped. "How do you know that?"

She exhaled with a puff of annoyance and a whisper. "I read, Igala. I have read all the instructions on the Zulu Time com-d site, forward and backward, finding the answer and the solution to my new future re-generator job."

I smiled. "O wow. How many people can be a hostess? I might apply too. What are the qualifications there?"

"One."

I frowned. "But there're two females now. They're twins, too. Twins, too? That's funny," chucking.

She exhaled. "You sound like Dfart over there with cute Ucal."

I frowned. "Dwit, Dfit, Dfun, Dfee, that's him over there. He doesn't use that funny term," smiling.

"Well, he should include it on his silly list."

"Why are you in a grumpy mood, today?"

She looked up with a gasp and then grinned. "Pressure. Pressure from my parents..."

"Tell me a new story!" I turned with an annoyed brow and touched the table surface with my naked hands and a nod. "I can understand."

She gasped with a smirk. "Why? What happened? Is that the reason for riding in your ancient car instead of driving it?"

"Yeah," I turned with a stern face and a nod to see my school friend since we were five years old. I could tell her my secret without getting into trouble with my parents. "Yeah, last night..."

"What? What about last night? It was the same old night, right, Igala?"

"I...I went to bed like always." I smiled with a nod without tattling my dark secret of Zulu Time. It was against the law to talk about Zulu Time to another citizen. I didn't want to break another Society law, since I didn't know if cute Ucal could or would save my fanny again. I frowned with a nod. "Yeah, it was the same old night of the same old routine of supper, study, and slumber." I stood upright from the chair and stretched out both arms into the air, arching my back spine with a smile and an ugly yawn. "I'm going into the kitchen. Do you want something, Minki?"

"No."

I turned from the table and moved into the kitchen with a stern face and my dark secret for some food.

At 02:02 pm (early afternoon) among warm temperatures and a stormy sky of dark clouds, inside the Hall classroom, re-generator teacher Twaddle said with a smile. "Please return all the com-ds to my desk. Hall is dismissed for those of you still lingering around here. Good evening. See everyone tomorrow."

Minki stood with a smile and moved from the table toward the archway, staring down into her personal com-d. "Bye..."

I looked up and watched her back spine leave the room, exhaling with a huff of annoyance and reached out, grabbing the two com-ds from the table. I stood upright and returned the devices to the teacher desk, turning to the archway.

The room was almost empty of students.

I had no choice to stay and study, without a rolling or a flying transport. My mom was flying through traffic to collect me from the bottom of the steps per her morning orders at home.

I stomped down the hallway alone and exited the building with a smile, stopping and standing beside Minki and looked up into the dark blue storm clouds for the car form my mom. "So did you receive a response to your hostess application from Zulu Time?"

She pinged on her com-d without looking to see Igala, "Yeah."

I smiled down at her blonde and painted black and pink hair roots. Minki enjoyed decorating her hair and her face in a set of geometric and funny shapes like the other teens. I enjoyed the fun activity until last night when my mom grounded my car, my face, and my hair all at the same time. I hovered over her with a painted face of angles, "And?"

"No go."

"So what's your default re-generator job?"

The hover car halted in the air and dropped down, landing on top of a circular parking lot that was posed around the front of the Hall building for a student pickup. The vertical door automatically opened up and exposed an empty passenger seat.

Minki smirked to Igala. "Rich." She swung to the car with a grin and a giggle and advanced down the last step, entering the car with her mom, sliding inside.

The vertical door closed down and locked shut.

I followed Minki as the car lifted into the air with a roar, leaving the Hall grounds. I smiled. "O. That's rich. I wonder how one re-generated that." I shaded my eyeballs, seeing the ride for home. I exhaled with a puff of annoyance at the thoughts of sitting and hearing my mom's lecture inside my left eardrum for the rest of the night.

03:03 pm (mid-afternoon)

Warm temperatures and dark storm clouds without sunshine

Home of Smith family

Living room setting

I sat at the dining room, studying my com-d for a re-generator job that I was qualified to perform.

The single knock was loud on the entrance door of the house.

Segue slid out from the chair, running ahead, slamming into the closed front door with a giggle and back stepped with a grin, grabbing the door knob.

The front door opened.

Segue back stepped with a grin and pointed at the stranger. "Mom, come look here, now."

My heart stopped and then restarted from the surprised sound of my brother. I stood upright from my chair and turned with a worried brow to see a Regulator.

The Regulator marched through the archway and stood a few inches inside the living room with a stern face of coppery gold, saying with a monotone timber. "You are invited to Zulu Time. The limousine will arrive in fifty-nine minutes. Each member is allowed many luggage units hanging from any and all the body part for the vital family protection. Each member does not need any type of additional clothing or a set of daily necessaries, since the such-like items will be provided at the Cee building. The Cee party of Family Smith will honor the invitation or face the Regulator. Thank you. Have a nice day." It, since it was hard to tell a female or a male human behind the copper colored face paint, back stepped and pivoted, moving back to a parked limousine inside the private driveway. The limousine drove away, since no one had bothered to close the front door of the house.

Henoana stood with an open mouth and dashed beside her daughter, turning with a sour frown and a sneer, "Igala?"

I danced back and forth in panic, waving both arms and shaking my curls. "I don't drive my car today. I didn't do anything wrong. I don't know what is happening here."

Henoana sneered, again. "Why are we going to Zulu Time for a second time, Igala? You mentioned that Ucal got us out of Zulu Time forever."

Genic stood upright from the sofa inside the living room, after helping Segue with the assignments and turned, tossing both palms in the air with a smile and a nod. "Calm, Smith family, everything is all right here."

Henoana turned and sneered at her husband. "Everything is not nice and calm, Genic. We are invited back into Zulu Time. We're going to Zulu Time for a second time. Why are we going to Zulu Time for the second time?"

Oltole shook her gray bun with a sad pout, standing upright from the sofa, holding the hand of Laddie and moved around the loose huddle of her family members. "Ucal is only a teenager. I guess, he..."

"...did everything right." Genic nodded with a smile. "This is all a mistake. I promise. That's all. When we arrive at the headquarters of Zulu Time, Ucal will be there too. I promise. Right now, all my talented and handsome children need to get dressed. Get upstairs. Move. We have less than an hour for the limo. I liked that fancy air limo from Zulu Time." He moved and stopped, hugging his wife.

Segue stomped side to side in place in front of the long sofa with a sour frown, "A bath, Mom?"

Genic nodded with a smile. "Shower your body for tonight's invitation to Zulu Time, again. I don't know who we might be introduced too, this evening. The entire family might need to see the Regulator too. So we all dress in a clean pair of jeans and a T-shirt, any color. And I want you to polish your boots too. Spit and shine like in granny's days. Hustle. We have less than an hour before..."

"Mom," Segue turned and frowned to his mom.

I stood in place, feeling worry and confused.

Genic and Henoana hugged each other with a smile. Genic leaned over with a whisper into her eardrum. They moved up the staircase to change and dress for a second visit to Zulu Time.

I exhaled with a puff of worry, turning and moving toward the garage door and grabbed the door knob.

The door opened.

My face was hit with a blast of warm air as I advanced down the steps and into a large square room that held all the automobiles and stopped in front of a long wall of rough wooden shelving. I squatted down on both kneecaps, leaning over and stretched out both arm muscles to each side and grabbed a set of garden tools, shifting into a low pile. I stood upright and spun around, moving back into the kitchen and the living room, scooting around the room and lifted, dumping out the contents inside two different backpacks over the floor. Then I swung around and moved back into the garage, squatting down, storing all the sharp and nasty looking garden tools into each backpack and stood upright with a sigh of heavy work. I leaned down and snatched up both backpacks, lifting each one over a collar bone with a grunt, slowly spinning around and moved back into the kitchen, planning the next step of Zulu Time with a whisper for my eardrums only. "I did everything wrong."

Cee Building location

04:04 pm (late afternoon)

Warm temperatures and storm clouds without sunshine

The pre-offered limousine slowed and hovered in the air, dropping and locking down on a pair of landing skis on top of the hard pavement and then it slowly lowered down to the ground for a second time with the Smith family. The four vertically doors lifted upright at the same time for drama.

A single Regulator stood in the center of a set of double golden doors in front of a tall white marble building as always for each criminal team. The victim teamed had already arrived in limousine style and was selecting a gown and a jacket for the upcoming Society Ball event at five o'clock, thus the lack of a Regulator in front of the pretty pink tinted Vee building.

I had learned that specific information from my previous scan on some of the Zulu Time rules and regulations last night while pretending to find a solution to our containment in the Cee building and wasting time to see the Regulator.

I slid out from the re-designer leather seat, moving away from the open door, dragging my baby sister by the tiny hand from the seat and stood with a puff of nervousness over the smooth gray painted concrete that matched the ugly gray paved roadway.

Segue moved away from the seat and stood beside Igala with a smile, dancing side to side with excitement. "Geez, I wished that I could record all this on my com-d. My friends would freak out with my fun time here at Zulu Time for a second time..."

I looked back over a collar bone to see my parents.

Henoana, Genic, and Oltole moved from the bench seat and stopped, standing in a row and away from the doors, head bumping with a set of whispers and hand movements. Genic stood in the middle with a smile and a nod, hugging each waist of his wife and his mother.

The limousine lifted up from the road pavement and flew ahead, moving away from the Zulu Time campus.

I turned with a sign of trouble to see the three familiar buildings for a second time.

There were three buildings ahead of the Smith family member again. The Cee building with a gigantic hand carved letter C that almost touched the blue colored skyline, standing next to a short wooden building that rested next to a much shorter squat pink tinted building. The pink tinted marble building had a set of silver glistening closed doors. The plain faded wooden building possessed a set of dark wooden doors.

The solo Regulator spun around and moved toward the set of wooden doors which automatically opened on the Cee Building. The Regulator moved into the dark hallway as the lead for the criminals for a second time.

Inside the white marble colored hallway setting, I moved forward, wiggling and shuffling the two backpacks over each collar bone.

Segue moved ahead and swung around with a grin and a giggle. "What's inside your backpacks? The Regulator said no need for clothes. Remember? We got the ugly jackets and the silly gloves that make my hands sweat."

I leaned forward with a wink and a whisper to see Segue. "The Regulator said no clothes, but it didn't say no undergarments."

Segue laughed with a nod, swinging around, entering through the archway.

I entered through the archway, seeing the same walls. The walls were solid marble and pretty white like a birthday cake with tiny sprinkles of gold paint. The smooth hard floor on both sides of the hallway and the fifty feet tall ceiling were all made of the white colored marble. The marble felt ice cold underneath the thin soles of my old worn cowgirl boots. The tall urns held a beautiful plume of flames, glowing against the white marble in the rainbow of colors from pink, purple, orange, yellow, blue, red, orange, silver, and gold, looking so serene and peaceful.

The white marble behind the walls, below the floor, and even above the hair roots of each member of the Smith family were a collection of dead bodies.

I stared ahead with my deep mental thoughts, without studying the white wall of coldness and the red colored urns of heat without a plume of gray ash.

This was designated as the criminal building. The pink marble building was the victim building which was small now but it was steadily growing taller too as each victim of the Vee team continued to challenge and to die inside Zulu Time, almost every night.

I gasped with smile. Yeah, the victim teams have lost for the past two weeks based on the hot gossiping lips of Minki. Therefore, the victim team will lose again, tonight. I hoped and prayed for a miracle. Then, all the busted and broken bloody dead bodies will be plopped on top of one another like a stack of cold pancakes.

Over the decades, the criminals or the nicknamed Cee team were ninety-nine point ninety-nine percent of the time really and truly guilty thugs, rapists, thieves, and murderers that all came from a batch of broken family homes within Society with nothing better to do but fight and then steal or kill. Since the introduction of Zulu Time, the Cee team was totally destroyed into death, including the immediate kin folks. The Vee team took possess immediately of all the asset properties of the criminal family, such as, the land, the house, the furniture, and the coin, if any. Therefore, the Cee team did not possess any assets but a broken bloody body or a batch of bodies. The people representatives didn't want a vile criminal of Zulu Time to be buried inside the city gravesite, so they can up with the ideal of a marker.

The Cee building and the Vee building was the physical markers for people to mentally remember. When you broke the law, then you became a criminal and then you fought and finally you died. You were placed here, resting and wasting away from the warmth of the ground inside a cold flat box of stone, not being able to touch the sky either like your heavenly soul was stuck in limbo.

Once the violent criminal element was eliminated, the representatives of the people dissolved the fair judicial system of human judges, human jury, and human lawyers. And then they created the Regulator. If you were mistreated, then you filed a complaint with the Regulator. If you were mistaken, then you were invited to Zulu Time.

I exhaled with a puff of worry, feeling afraid that Ucal could not save my family from Zulu Time, tonight, for a second time. So I must do it. This was my problem, again.

I looked back over a collar bone to see my parents.

Genic, Henoana, and Oltole were slowly moving behind Igala, head bumping with a set of whispers and slow hand flips.

I turned and looked down with a worried brow to see the marble, trying not to think of the pile of preserved human bones and dried blood proteins that lingered between me, the walls, the ceiling, and the floor. However, ice cold chills invaded my back spine of creepy and coldness.

Segue ran ahead of his two sisters as Laddie twisted and jerked a tiny hand from the loose gripe of Igala. They both dashed ahead with a set of giggles and grins, performing a set of cartwheels and jumping jacks over the smooth marble like a pair of innocent playing children. When they reached a few feet from the back spine of the Regulator, they stopped with a set of heavy breathes and stared at the action.

The single coppery golden colored Regulator from the set of front doors paced ahead without talking with its words or pointing with its fingers.

There was a second set of double doors in golden tint at the end of the straight corridor. There were two giant urns of fire, shining against the golden metal. The building did admit a single ray of bright sunlight, thus the heat of each flaming urn provided the only source of light too.

The Regulator stopped and pivoted in the front of double golden doors as the fire light stretched and illuminated the copper color into a yellowish gold, making the Regulator a glowing angel for a few seconds. Then the Regulator side stepped into the wall, hiding between one of the wall corner fiery urns, without talking or pointing.

In front of the Cee chamber suite of rooms among the cold temperatures and bright walls of dead people, her brother Segue reached out and grabbed, holding the tiny hand of Laddie, slowly moving ahead and into the familiar cold white tinted rectangular shaped hallway of hidden rooms, turning to stare with a stern face at the robot-like Regulator. Once he and she cleared the archway, they ran ahead and dashed down the long hallway with a set of squeaks and laugher, twirling around and around over the smooth marble.

I continued to pace at a steady gait and followed behind the back spines of my brother and my sister into the familiar room, feeling each heavy backpack bruise a shoulder blade with a soft grunt of pain. The room was a long and wide rectangular room in white marble on the ceiling, the side walls, and the floor. There was a set of square shaped marble archways on each side wall, as far as, I could see. I stopped and stood in front of a marble island in the middle of the long hallway, looking back over a collar bone to see my parents.

They slowly advanced in a row, head butting with whispers and smiles, strolling through the archway and split apart, stopping and stood around the marble island like a tall table without a set of sitting chairs.

Laddie ran down the long hallway as her boots loudly clomped over the smooth marble. She stopped and smiled with a yell inside the familiar archway of the room. "My princess coach bed with gold sparkles with four silver wheels and a ladder." She dashed again and disappeared through the archway.

Segue slid to a stop with a grin, pointing inside the room. "Hey, the room's cleaned up from my mess from last night, too. Why's that? Whatever! Racing car room. My room. My room." He entered and disappeared into room also.

Henoana stood around the marble island, turning with a worried and a whisper to see her husband. "What do we do now?"

I chuckled with a grin and slipped off the two heavy backpacks from each collar bone, leaning them over the upright island stand, since my mom had used the same sentence last night. I looked down with a slight smirk and pinged on my com-d for the next step.

Genic ran both hands over the smooth marble island with a smile and a nod. "We rest up for the dance and supper meal at five. The meal was good, last night. And the dancers were entertaining. Today, we dance and have fun, too. Let's go, dear." He reached out and grabbed her hand, cuddling her into his chest with a smile and a hum, back stepping from the island, strolling down the hallway to one of the adult selected bedrooms.

Oltole shook her gray bun with a confused frown and stood at the marble island. "I'll take the same room from last night. The bed mattress was comfortable. I'm tired. I'm taking a nap, if your mom or your dad needs me, Igala."

I stood alone at the marble island and stared down at the shapes of dozens of perfectly formed rings from previously spilled beverages or sweaty bottles of water, staining the porous surface of yesterday years of dead folks with a worried brow. I leaned both elbows against the hard marble, looking down with a confused brow and tapped, pinging on my com-d, finding all the rules of Zulu Time, again.

Yeah, I hit the car on the spot. Yeah, Ucal paid for it on the spot. Yeah, I came to Zulu Time and then left on the same night. Yeah, the procedure was the same.

I whispered with a confused brow. "Okay. So maybe, this is just a formality of Zulu Time, entertaining a compliant with the Regulator. Or the more logical conclusion is that this is a formality mistake, a formality boo-boo, a formality of a wrong person, which isn't me." I tapped and pinged on the com-d for an answer for a few minutes. Then I slowly curled my lips into a wicked grin and a soft whisper without disturbing my parents. "I found it. I found you. Within Society City Four too, there is a female named Igee Smith. Yay! That makes perfect sense. I'm Igala with the letter 'a' after the letter 'I.' She has the letter 'e' after the letter 'I.' Of course, the letter 'a' always comes before the letter 'e' in the standard alphabet. Of course, this is a formality error. Of course, the old bat probably killed and ate her cat or something vile. This is massive gigantic mistake. I'm still innocent and will see sunrise tomorrow."

I lifted both arms with the com-d above my hair roots and spun around with a smile and halted with a puzzled brow.

The entrance doors parted and opened at the same time.

A person stood inside the room with a head of shoulder length strawberry blonde hair and a face of red whiskers as his aura glowed between the sparkling golden metal of the twin doors.

I gasped with shock, running toward the figure with a smile and a whisper. "Ucal, you came..."

The doors closed shut as the figure disappeared behind the glittering metal of gold.

I halted with a gasp, turning with a puzzled brow to see the side wall, a hanging rack of re-designer female clothes. I turned with a confused brow to see the other wall, a hanging rack of re-designer male jackets.

I turned and faced the golden tinted closed doors with a sad pout and a whisper. "It was a Regulator that glowed between the two fire plumes inside the urns. Ucal is not coming to my rescue, tonight."

Laddie exited her selected bedroom, turning with a gasp and a smile, running through the hallway to the rack of clothes. "The pretty dresses are here. Pretty dress. Pretty dress. I wanna new pretty dress." She dashed by Igala and grabbed the leg stand of the clothes rack, sliding sideways with a giggle, standing upright and touched the dress tail, since she was too small to reach a hanger.

I swung around to see my relatives within my slow thoughts, playing out the same movements and saying the same lines from last night.

Henoana marched down the hallway, leading Genic and Segue and stopped at the rack of female re-designer clothes and stood in place, reaching and grabbed a tea length dress for Laddie, matching her height and her weight proportions. She handed it to Laddie with a smile and a pat on top of the black colored hair roots of her baby daughter.

Laddie spun around with a grim and moved forward down the hallway, dragging the mint green dress over the floor to her selected bedroom. Henoana moved and grinded each hanger over the rack with a sour frown, selecting an evening gown, a pair of matching shoes and sandals of sea green color.

Genic stopped by the island and sipped on the cold water bottle, dropping it down to the island with a splash, turning with a smile and a nod to see his wife. He grabbed his son by the shoulders, moving ahead toward the male re-designer rack and picked an amber colored jacket. Then he and Segue spun around and moved back down the hallway toward the selected bedroom to dress.

Henoana swung around and moved to her selected bedroom and Igala, saying with a smile and a nod, rolling the dress and accessories into a ball over her arm. "Get dressed, Igala. The Regulators will be here soon. And get down to the bathroom and paint on your raccoon eyeballs." She stopped and entered the room of Laddie first.

I shook from the loud voice and blinked my eyelashes open, lubricating a pair of dry eyeballs from staring into a repeated nightmare. I leaned over and grabbed the first dress in my height range with a puzzled brow and a confused mind, dragging the fabric into my body and felt the rough sequins with a whisper for my eardrums only. "No, it was mistake. I found the name which is not me. I must tell the Regulator after the ball like I did last night." I reached and replaced the tight fitting blue sequined gown for a new one, a larger sized short-sleeved gigantic fluffy purpled colored plantation gown. I jerked it down from the hanger and lifted, flinging the gown into the air and over my hair roots, wiggling it down over my T-shirt and my blue jeans, wearing my cowgirl boots. It would be easier to remove the gown from my body as I ran down the hallway to the Regulator office for a second time to tattle tale about the formality error of Igee Smith, not Igala Smith.

I jerked the pair of matching short hand gloves from the hanger clip, slowly swishing ahead in the thick fabric between my legs toward the marble island, resting both my com-d and my short hands gloves over the smooth surface, moving down the hallway and into the bathroom for the raccoon eyeballs, repeating the old knowledge.

The Zulu Time Ball was the next step in the Zulu Time process, where each family of the Cee and Vee teams danced and dined for less than one hour, unknowingly mysterious for some reason. It was a formal dance with a formal long gown like a royal ball. One set of racks held the female attire wardrobe, including a set of matching shoes and a pair of long gloves. The other rack was a set of male jackets and a pair of hand gloves. The males wore their blue jeans and their cowboy boots to the ball dinner and dance.

Inside the Girl's Bathroom setting, I stood inside the archway of the correct bathroom, seeing the same repeated scene of my sister and my mom.

Laddie danced in front of the mirror and the first wet sink counter with a smile and a new song, wearing a pair of raccoon-eyes with an elongated V-shape black color pattern from one earlobe across both eye sockets to the other earlobe without the brown colored foundation over her cheekbones.

Henoana smiled and repeated the same words from last night, telling Laddie to stand still, pinning the hair into a bun, and go back to your room for the moment. Then she turned with a smile to archway and asked if Igala wanted her hair pinned up also.

"No ma'am." I stood in the archway with a whisper, feeling scared and worry.

Laddie turned with a grin and a hum, skipping out the bathroom and down the hallway. Henoana turned with a set of raccoon-eyes on a face smooth pale tone, moving to Igala and patted the collar bone with a smile, advancing down the hallway.

I entered and moved to the same wet sink, reaching and lifted a wet paint brush of rich black. I didn't need to study the paper drawing on the mirror to draw the raccoon-eyes. I lightly brushed a thin layer of black around my eye sockets, looking more charcoal gray rather than rich black with a whsiper for my eardrums only. "It is a mistake..."

I dropped the wet paint brush down into the wet and dirty sink, standing alone inside the bathroom, staring at a silly face, feeling sick to my stomach from the word exchange with my dad. Genic believed that Ucal would come to the rescue of his family, again, for a second time.

I exhaled with a puff of dread. I couldn't tell my mom and my dad the truth. I was too nervous with my own raw emotions to explain the issue, so I would not bother to fix my long straight black hair, resting down my back spine and turned, moving out the bathroom and down the hallway.

The entrance doors were opened.

I couldn't believe the time had passed so quickly.

At the entrance doors, her family moved through the open archway, advancing down the hallway to the Zulu Time Ball.

I gasped with surprise, lifting the dress up my kneecaps, exposing the blue jeans and ran down the hallway, seeing a tall figure with a head of shoulder length strawberry colored hair and a face of red whiskers that glowed in the air waves from the twin flames of light, advancing to him with a smile and a whisper for my eardrums only. "Ucal, he did come." I skidded to halt, dropping open a mouth.

The Regulator stood in front of the open doors, lifting and pointing an index finger down at her feet.

I looked down with a gasp and a puzzled brow to see tip of my pointy boot toes underneath the dress, lifting and slammed both hands down over the ankle-length re-designer dress with a sour frown and a whisper, "Yeah, the sandals." I scooted and leaned down, grabbing a pair of matching purpled high heeled sandals, plopping my buttocks down near the rack on top of the hard cold floor with the extra padding of dress and the blue jeans, removing one sock and one boot and replace it for a glittering jeweled sandal that hurt my naked toes. I stood upright with a sour frown and swung around, dashing toward the marble island, grabbing the gloves but leaving my com-d and swung around with a sour face.

The Regulator turned with a stern face of coppery gold plus a pair of silver sunglasses and moved down the hallway with a fast pace.

I lifted the dress up to my kneecaps, exposing the blue jeans fabric and followed behind in silence, tapping over the smooth floor and turned the wall corner, stomping over the familiar wooden floor and plain wooden hallway. And then I turned into a second wall corner, leading into the ball room.

Zulu Time Ball

Banquet room location

05:10 pm (late afternoon)

Warm temperatures and cloudy sky

I stopped and stood inside the open archway, seeing and heard the same sounds from last night.

The dancing couples shuffled across the floor. The dinner plates rattled against the silverware and glass tumblers. The smiling faces were professional dances and did not participate in Zulu Time death games, tonight.

I saw my parents move across the room and sat inside two long sofas against the far corner wall, looking back over a collar bone to see an empty hallway and turned around to see the happy dancers. I moved through the archway, feeling like a ghost with nerves and a cowgirl with a fancy apron. I wore my dirty pair of blue jeans and my dirtier T-shirt underneath the fancy plantation purple colored dress for a quick escape from the chamber suite to tattle tale to the Regulator about a formality error of Igala Smith for a second time.

I reached the wall corner, finding two sofas empty, turning with a puzzled brow to see my blood relatives. Oltole stood in the middle of the dance floor, twirling Laddie and Segue around in circle with each hand, wearing a smile of laughter. Genic and Henoana danced cheek to cheek, enjoying the music and the fun night. I exhaled with a puff of worry for my happy family, leaning against the wall, crossing my arms and watched the happy people. I felt depressed, scared, mad, angry, and unhappy. I uncrossed my arms with a puff of worry, pulling from the wall, moving to the beverage table and stopped, stood upright and reached over for a bottle of cold water. I continued to stand and fiddle with the beverage, twirling it around and around over the wooden scratched and ugly table, feeling alone and afraid.

Two arms attacked and wrapped around Igala as his face smiled into her vanilla smelling hair. "Hey, beauty, wanna dance?"

I smiled down at the twirling cold beverage with a little happiness now. "Dfee, you're so un-smooth at a time like this."

Dfee leaned down with a smile and a whisper into her eardrum. "Rednecks always are."

I released and left the beverage on the table and swung around to see his warm smile. "Is Ucal here?"

He winked at her. "Who cares? I'm here. You're here. Let's dance to the music, beauty."

I frowned. "Why am I here?"

"...to dance with me." He grabbed her gloved hand, turning and leading them into the semi-crowded dance floor and swung around into her face with a smile. They slowly moved side to side in the same spot.

"I know why my family is here for the second time." I turned in the dance spin to see my parents. Henoana and Genic were huddled together like a pair of love birds, dancing to the soft slow musical number, looking into each other eyeballs and enjoyed the nice atmosphere. Oltole continued to sway side to side in her new old fashioned beige colored gown, holding the hand of Segue and Laddie as the kids wiggled side to side with grins and giggles. I swung into his grin and smiled with a whisper. "I found it. I found another female..."

He exhaled. "Beauty, the female is...."

"Igala..." She moved and stood a little below the nose profile of Igala, looking up to see the hair roots and down to see the toenails of Igala with a smirk and finally stopped a pair of eyeballs with a smile to see the eyeballs of Igala. "Nice to see ya outta of the ripped jeans and dull polished cowgirl boots for a change."

"Minki?" I turned and frowned down at Minki, who wore a set of black raccoon eyes and a red tight evening gown. I had known her face for years from the screen and immediately recognized her petite statue with a set of waist long blonde down her back. I gasped. "Why are you here?"

Minki turned and winked to Dfee as she recognized his tallness and his handsomeness inside the silly rose colored jacket and matching hand gloves behind the ugly set of black colored raccoon eyes. "I got invited. This is the invitation part, right, Dfart?"

He turned and smiled at Minki. "Right, Mick. We all got invited here, tonight. Well, me and beauty are dancing. So shove it or off? Please, pick one forever, smelly fish?" laughing.

She turned and winked to Igala. "I'm going to find Ucal and dance with him. Will that make you jealous, Igala?"

"No." I frowned.

Dfee turned and dragged Igala onto the dance floor with a sour frown, swinging around and pulled her into his rose colored jacket and gloved hands with a stern face.

I exhaled with worry. "Why is she here? Why am I here? I used the option regulation. We departed the Cee building, last night. Now, I'm back."

"I'm back too. But it's a mystery to me about your family in Zulu Time for a second try, too." He turned and frowned at the Smith huddle on the dance floor, returning his eyeballs to Igala.

I exhaled. "Not a mystery to me, Ucal lied to me. I had used Option, but it didn't work. I am facing..."

"Beauty, Ucal is a lot of rough and tough things, but he doesn't lie. Option is both legal and useful."

I frowned. "Well, can I use Option tonight for a second time?"

Dfee frowned. "I don't know. Are you guilty of a second crime?"

I looked down with a worried brow to see the floor and back up to see him. "I don't know the crime that I did or done. Or didn't do? Is Ucal here? Which one is he?"

"Yeah," He turned and scanned the dancers on the floor and at the wall with a smile. "He's here somewhere flirting with another girl." He turned and frowned to Igala. "If I point him out, then I can't dance with you, beauty," chuckling.

I gasped. "Stop it, Dfee. I'm about to go into Zulu Time again. I'm afraid, scared. I might..."

"No, you won't." He smiled.

I frown. "How do you know that?"

He smiled. "Ucal told me that he's working out something with the Regulator."

I sobbed. "How can he do that? Why is he doing that? What is going on here with me inside Zulu Time?"

They slowly danced within the same circle, without drawing attention from the wall of staring Regulators.

I whispered. "Ucal's parents are high up in the Regulator chain. That's cheating."

He chuckled. "That's saving your cute fanny, beauty. But I get all the credit and your cute buttocks."

"You?" I frowned. "You came up with the idea."

".... of dancing with you, while Ucal flirts with the Regulators."

"There're robots."

"No, beauty."

"There're not humans."

"No."

Ucal moved from the wall of Regulators and stopped, standing and leaning with a minty breath into the nose profile of Dfee, "Move, redneck."

Dfee released Igala and side stepped aside with a smile, reaching and touched a rose colored glove to her cheekbone with a wink and a whisper. "This is a social party, not a goodbye ball."

I smiled with a nod to him in silence.

Ucal reached up with a coral gloved hand and grabbed the arm of Igala, swinging them away from Dfee, leaning into her face with a stern face and a whisper, wearing a matching coral colored jacket underneath his ripped and faded blue jeans. "When you return back to your suite, you will be asked to pick an environment..."

I frowned. "I saw Minki. She's here. Why is she here at the Zulu Time Ball? How does one get an invitation to the Zulu Time Ball anyways? Who would accept an invitation into the Zulu Time Ball anyways? I would not ever, never..."

"Listen, Igala! You are required to pick an environment for Zulu Time."

I gasped. "Minki is here too. She got an invitation to be here, too. No."

"Yes."

I shook my curls. "Nope."

"Yeah."

I exhaled. "Because she is claiming to be a victim, she's on the victim team. Not right, Minki wasn't harm in my car accident. She was a sitting and annoying passenger inside my car that day. This isn't right. I need to tell the Regulator."

"It doesn't matter. She told a Regulator before you, gorgeous."

"It matters to me."

"It doesn't matter, now." He frowned. "You are required to pick an environment for Zulu Time."

"Pick an environment, for what?"

"The Bowl..."

I gasped with fear. "I must fight Minki inside the Bowl. I saw the Bowl the other night on the wall of glass at my house. It's a place of death and dying. Everyone fights each other with both hands and weapons." I sobbed and held back the hot tears, feeling the cold breath of death on my neck with a whisper. "I don't understand."

"You and your family are all going into Zulu Time at seven pm. As you stand on the floor, take the microphone and call out the word, Tag."

"Tag, what's a Tag?" I frowned.

He said with a stern face and a serious tone. "The Regulators are coming at 6:45 pm to escort all your family members into the Zulu Time room. Zulu Time starts at seven sharp. When you get into the Zulu Time room, call out the word, Tag. Do not try to argue your true story..."

"No." I gasped and shoved him from our cuddle. "I must defend my justification case. I'm not the criminal here."

He pulled her closer with a worried brow. "Okay. You can take your chance with the viewing audience to see if they will favor you and your car wreck over Minki as a passenger."

I exhaled. "They will not. I would not, if I had listened to my sorry sissy story."

He nodded with a whsiper. "So right, the Bowl is an equal chance for the Cee team and Vee team to battle it out, even the odds for the weaken team or the true victims of Zulu Time."

"Me."

"Yes, you and your family," He frowned. "You are required to pick an environment for Zulu Time."

I whined. "I don't wanna go into Zulu Time. I don't wanna fight inside the Bowl. No, I'm going to use Option and run and face the Regulator for a second time."

Ucal spun them around in a small circle with a stern face and a whisper. "You cannot."

I frowned with a whisper. "You told me to use Option and I did last night. It worked the first time. I will use it this time too."

Ucal spun them into the wall corner and stopped, leaning down and kissed her face as she tensed and then relaxed, enjoying the softness of lips. He pulled back with a frown and a whisper. "You have so little faith in me."

"But..." I stood upright with a worried brow and a worried heart.

Then the gong sounded with a deep dong.

Ucal released her body with a smile and a slight bow, moving to hug her again.

I frowned with a whisper. "Is that a good bye kiss?"

He chuckled with a whisper. "No. It's a good to see you kiss and a good for being your friend kiss and finally a good night kiss. And you must pick water for your Zulu Time environment inside the Bowl. I promise that I'll see you at school, tomorrow." He back stepped with a stern face and swung around, moving swiftly to the far archway, leaving Igala at the wall.

I wiped my wet lips with the glove and spun around with a worried brow, strolling back to my family. My family and I moved to the same exit inside the dance hall. I felt the same worry and confusion for a second time, swishing across an empty dance floor in my formal gown, since the non-Zulu Time people swiftly left the room, leaving my family and the team of two Regulators, even Minki and her biological family unit were gone. I followed last in the row behind the back spines of my family.

Genic hugged his wife, whispering into her face with a smile. Oltole followed behind Genic and Henoana, holding the hand of Laddie. Segue danced beside his granny and wiggled side to side with a smile and a hum.

The two Regulators moved down the wooden floor and turned the wall corner, advancing down the long white colored marble floor.

I licked my lips, tasting the sweetness of Ucal, longing for a few more dances or a few close hugs or a few wet kisses from him, before my presentation into Zulu Time at seven pm.

The Regulators stopped in front of the pair of golden tinted metal doors, back stepping into a side wall between the flaming urns and the entrance doors, looking like a pair of two angel figures of death.

Genic and Henoana slowly paced toward the door.

The doors opened.

They moved ahead and advanced down the hallway toward the bathrooms to remove the painted raccoon eyeballs. Oltole followed behind them toward the bathroom for the makeup removal procedure too.

I slowly moved ahead and stopped, standing in the front of the marble island with a worried brow, hearing and seeing the same repeated nightmare of last night. I whispered for my eardrums only. "I'm going into Zulu Time..."

Her parents entered the correct bathroom, removing the makeup with screams and yelps from the children. Her family members exited the bathroom archway and advanced down the hallway, coming back to Igala and the entrance doors. The children turned and ran down the hallway and into a selected bedroom for some fast fun and play. The adults moved in a line with whispers and nods, splitting and surrounding the marble island like a table, without a set of chairs, and then all eyeballs looked to stare at Igala.

I blinked my eyelashes open as my mind focused back into reality, seeing the happy smiles and the twinkling eyeballs of my relatives.

"What's the next step, Igala?" Henoana smiled.

"We know the next step, dear. We wait for the Regulator to show like he or she or it did last night. It or he or she sounded like a girl to me." Genic smiled with a nod. "Then we change outta of our clothes and go home." He turned and moved down the hallway toward the room with a yell and a grin. "Segue, get out of these clothes. Get into your jeans, son."

"Well, we can get outta of our fancy clothes, now. Everyone put back on your personal clothes. We will be leaving in a few minutes. And get those raccoon eyes off, Igala." Henoana swung around and ran down the hallway, chasing after her baby daughter. "Laddie, come here. We need to get dress to leave soon, sweetheart."

"No." Laddie turned and ran into a new bedroom. Henoana turned and followed behind.

The door closed.

I removed my gloves and left my com-d on the island table, scooting around the island, slowly moving down the hallway with a whisper. "I am going to Zulu Time..."

Moving down the hallway towards the Girl's Bathroom, I slowly moved through the archway and stopped, standing in front of the mirror with a worried brow and a whisper for my eardrums only. "I can't be going into Zulu Time. Everything is the same. The home visit. The limo ride. The cold rooms of the dead. The ball. Ucal. Dfee. Minki is the nasty floating variable here, tonight. So Ucal is wrong. He isn't a Regulator. He is a teen like me. So, I stay dressed and go and see the Regulator. And explain that Minki was only a passenger inside my car during the car accident. She wasn't driving or standing outside the car or inside the other driver's car. Yeah, she didn't get hurt. She didn't cry. She didn't yell at me. Yeah, it is my story. It is my truth. Yeah, right." I leaned down and washed my face from the black makeup, getting the dress dirty again. I didn't care. I was going to see the Regulator and tell the truth.

Then Minki would get into trouble, not Igala.

I stood upright with a wet face, seeing a smile for the first time today with a nod. "Yeah, I always tell the truth. Minki has lied and she will get into trouble by the Regulator and her parents." I swung to see the archway and lifted the dress up to my blue jean-covered kneecaps, running down the hallway with my new plant of action with a smile and a whisper. "It worked, last night. It will work, tonight."

I skimmed to a halt, swinging around and slammed into the front of the marble island, grabbing my gloves and looked down to see my com-d on top of the island surface.

The time read 6:38 pm.

I nodded with a whisper. "I need to leave. I can be a little early, since my story is longer, this time. I don't know what Ucal meant by his word, Tag, either. And I don't care. He is wrong. I am right." I wrestled with the pair of short gloves over both my shaky hands, lifting and trying to lock my com-d wrist watch over my naked arm without success. I removed one of the gloves when I felt a cool breeze hit my neckline from behind my back spine.

I slowly turned around to see the doors.

The golden glittering entrance doors parted and opened at the same time.

A tall figure with a head of shoulder length strawberry colored hair and a face of red whiskers glowed in the air waves from the twin flames of light.

I advanced to him with a smile and a whisper for my eardrums only. "Ucal, he came for me." I skidded to halt and dropped open a mouth.

The Regulator stopped and stood in front of the open doors, flaming in coppery glory again, lifting and pointed with an index finger down at a mechanic device inside the other coppery golden colored palm.

I looked down with a puzzled brow to see a set of blinking words in a tone of bright blue inside the black background of the hand-held devise: Pick an environment?

I slammed a glove over my parted lips with a gasp, holding back my tears. So true, I was going into Zulu Time. Ucal told me to pick the environment of water. I reached out with a shaky hand, wiggling my index finger and typed out each small letter: w.a.t.e.r.

The device blinked and then beeped, showing the capital word in red colors: RECORDED.

The Regulator back stepped and turned in silence.

In the distance, a set of two hovering racks of clothes floated over the marble and entered the room, splitting and landing in front of first two racks of clothing on the side walls.

I gasped with a fear, covering my parted lips with my glove and my naked hand, sobbing with the truth of my future that was being measured in only minutes and seconds, now.

All the re-designer gowns and two piece tuxedoes were the same color of aqua. The same solid color was represented by the Cee team inside the tan colored room of Zulu Time at seven pm for the justification crime.

I back stepped from the racks of clothing and heard.

The other members of the Smith family exited from their selected bedrooms, turned to face the entrance doors, dashing down the long hallway and stopped beside the marble island in shock.

Laddie jumped up and down with a smile, pointing at the rack of clothes. "Pretty dress. Pretty dress, I wanna another pretty dress, Mommy."

"The dresses are all aqua colored. Why is that?" Oltole stopped beside Laddie, staring at the clothes with a puzzled brow.

"What is going on here, Igala?" Henoana parked both hands on her hips with a confused brow, stopping beside Igala, staring at the rack of re-designer dresses.

I wiped the moisture for my eyeballs, slowly swinging around with a fake smile to see my mom. "Okay. Now, we all go to Zulu Time..."

"What?" Henoana turned and gasped at the nose profile of Igala. "Why are we going to Zulu Time, Igala?"

I lifted and shook my com-d near a fake smile with a steady timber. "The information is right here on my com-d, stating all the rules for Ucal. He is our chosen representative, again, for a second time. He will meet us inside Zulu Time."

Henoana sneered. "Why, Igala?"

I lowered the com-d, pointing down see to the screen with a fake smile and a worried heart. "Look, I am just reading and following the rules, Mom. So, we gotta change our clothes from the new re-designer rack of clothes in the same color like..."

Henoana frowned. "We know that. We saw that on the glass, the other night. We need to wear some type of symbol on our faces in color too."

"I wanna a black and red and green and yellow and orange race car over my face. Zoom, zoom, zoom..." Segue stood next to his dad and waved both arms through the air with a laugh and a smile.

"Dolly, mommy, I wanna dolly..." Laddie reached up and jerked on the blue jeans of Henoana with a smile.

Genic nodded with a smile to the entrance doors and the two racks of clothing. "All right, we get a set of new ugly aqua colored clothes and some silly facial designs. Everyone get dressed for our meeting with Ucal. I bet he laughs his a..."

"Genic!" Oltole turned and gasped at the nose profile of her son.

Henoana moved ahead and stood beside the new rack of aqua colored re-designer gowns, reaching and lifted a dress for her and Laddie, handing both the items to Oltole with a nod. Oltole reached out and grabbed a dress in her size, gently shoving Laddie and carried all three re-designer dresses, slowly moving back down the hallway and into her private bedroom for dressing. Henoana exhaled with a nod to see Genic, Segue, and Igala. "Okay, I'll dash back down to the bathroom and collect the makeup and bring to your individual room and then you can decorate any symbol that you want." She turned and ran down the hallway.

The bedroom door of Oltole closed shut.

Genic nodded with a smile. "Okay, it is time to get dressed up again and finish this thing up. It's getting late in the evening. I have to work tomorrow morning." He grabbed out and shoved on the collar bone of Segue toward the re-designer rack for a second time this evening and picked out a tuxedo in aqua with a black tie and a pair of matching hand gloves that properly fit both bodies and spun around with a smile, moving down the hallway and turned into Segue's selected bedroom.

The second bedroom door closed.

I watched in silence. Her family members dressed for their presentation inside Zulu Time at seven pm. My mind clicked with ideas. I needed to see the Regulator and tell her or she or it about the true car accident story and save the other lives of my family. Maybe, I could be presented into Zulu Time alone, receiving the punishment of death alone, too.

I sobbed with my tears, swallowing the thick mucus.

Henoana exited from the bathroom, cuddling a set of colored packs of powder, stopping at Genic's room and Oltole's room, dishing out the individual makeup packs for the painted symbols and moved, stopping and standing in front of Igala with a smile. "I got left the color of white. The color will shine against your precious white skin tone. Get dressed! We need to find Ucal before..."

"Yeah..." I snatched the white powder with a stern face and a worried heart.

Henoana spun around and dashed back to the room of Oltole with her dress to change, stopping and knocked, opening the door.

And the door closed.

I swung around with a sigh of worry, moving toward the rack, finding and touched a thin ankle-length sheath dress in my size, since the firing bullets would penetrate the thin fabric quickly, if Minki selected a semi-automatic gun over a manual bow and an arrow for her death weapon.

I didn't believe that petite and weak Minki was strong enough to use a manual hand drawn bow and an arrow to kill me on the tan colored forward wall of Zulu Time, since her story was going to be better than any fairy tale that I could lie from my pink-painted lips during the twenty seconds of my justification case.

I whispered for my eardrums only. "I am going to die in Zulu Time." I jerked the dress down and the pair of matching elbow gloves from the rack and swung around with a sour frown with the tub of face powder, moving ahead toward the marble island and stopped, leaning down and lifted up the two heavy backpacks with the other hand. I moved ahead into the first room, again, for second time and slammed a sweaty palm into the door.

The bedroom door opened.

Inside my new chamber room, I moved toward the bed, stopping and tossed the dress, the gloves, and powder onto the bedcover and gently lowered the two heavy backpacks onto the floor.

The bedroom door closed.

I ripped off the wet and dirty gown and my set of regular clothes, standing in my nakedness, feeling numb and cold. I reached up and brushed away the hot tears from my lips, where a male would ever kiss me again. I reached down and brushed my cold nipples, where I would never breastfeed a child. I touched my pubic hair, where I would never love my future husband.

I whispered with my tears. "I don't wanna die. I didn't do anything wrong. I bumped into a piece of a metal, a metal life form, without blood or tears or emotions." I reached out and grabbed the powder, opening the tube. The color of white winked and sparkled in delight at my eyeballs.

I grabbed the brush and rubbed the white powder, lifting and smearing a set of glowing star designs over each cheekbone. The moment of death, I would see the billions of twinkling white stars among the black color of outer space as my soul floated up and around the galaxy. I finished the star design, tossing the open tube over the black bedcover, spilling the white sparkling powder.

It looked pretty and fresh like a dead body.

I reached out and grabbed my girly panties first, slipping up my legs. And the dress of soft satin slipped down over my face, smearing the white stars, without a care, and down a slender body, without the aid of a mirror. There wasn't a reflection mirror inside the bedroom, reminding a person of the cycle of life and death.

My eyelashes darted to the folded blood red T-shirt with a whisper and a worried brow without upsetting the she-ghosts inside my room. "The Cee team wears blood red to cover any bleeding injuries. The Vee team dresses in silvery baby blue." I exhaled with a puff of fear, holding my breath, closing my eyelashes. "Don't cry. Don't panic. Because I am going to die in a few minutes, I wonder if death hurts." I gasped for air, slowly pressing both hands down the soft and cool fabric, feeling numb.

A knock sounded on the metal door.

I jumped with a tiny heart attack inside my worried heart, turning with a sad face to see the closed door.

The door did not open.

One of her parents had knocked on the door and moved back into the hallway of the suite of rooms.

I back stepped from the bed mattress, rolling my two naked feet into a pair of matching sandals and my arms into a pair of elbow-length gloves and slowly spun around with a worried brow, moving toward the door and touched the metal with my nose.

Metal didn't work with clothing.

The door automatically opened.

I moved forward with a stern face and a worried heart, seeing my family.

Her family stood in a line, staring at the golden tinted entrance doors, starting with Segue, Oltole, Laddie, Genic, and Henoana.

I pulled up beside Henoana, fidgeting inside my aqua colored dress, hearing the soft musical tone of the painted white facial design stars, my death march.

At 06:45 pm, the entrance doors opened with an array of glittering colors of yellow, red, and blue fire sparks.

A line of Regulators moved forward and entered the Cee chamber suite and stopped, standing without movement or words, making the atmosphere creepy.

I stared at the row of glittery coppery golden bodies, without words and with tons of mixed emotions.

Genic reached out and grabbed the hand of his wife with a smile and a nod. "It's all right, dear. You heard Igala. This is part of the new procedure to meet Ucal inside Zulu Time. Follow us, kids." He cuddled his wife, moving ahead to the line of Regulators.

The row of Regulators spun around at the same time as one unit, marching ahead of the Smith family over the marble floor without sounds or words.

I turned and stared into my mom's worried eyeballs too as we thought the same fear.

Genic and Henoana led the Smith family, following behind the line of Regulators. Oltole moved and followed behind the back spines of Genic and Henoana, holding the hands of Laddie. Segue danced between his parents and his grandmother. I exhaled with a puff of fear in silence and moved beside my grandmother.

The line of Regulators turned the wall corner, moving over the wooden floor which was in the same direction as the dance hall.

Oltole leaned over and frowned with a whisper into the cheekbone of Igala. "Where are we going?"

I smiled with a nod and a whisper, dancing side to side with happiness, recognizing the hallway that led toward the Regulator office. "To see the Regulator, yes, I can explain..."

The line of Regulators stopped and stood a few feet from a solid wall of dark wood panel. In front of the solid wood panel, there was nothing but wood with a set of two perpendicular hallways. One intersection jaunted to the right, heading down into the Regulator office. And the other hallway to the left went down into the dance hall.

The first Regulator of the line stepped forward and slammed a palm into the wood, moving back into the line again.

The solid wood parted with a creak as a set of heavy doors slowly drifted inward, revealing a floor of black carpet and a set of walls in dark glass. The room looked like an old fashioned dungeon with a taste of modern day décor.

The middle Regulator stepped forward, entering the dark room as the rest of the Regulators shifted and formed an air space section for the Smith family into the mystery room.

Genic moved forward and dragged the aqua colored elbow gloved hand of Henoana into the room with a smile and a whisper into her face. "We meet Ucal in here somewhere." Henoana moved next to her husband and turned, scanning the room in silence.

Oltole followed behind the back spine of Genic and Henoana in silence, scanning the dark room with her old eyeballs, holding the tiny hands of Laddie.

Segue danced beside his grandmother with a whisper of worry. "What is this? This is different from anything that I have seen before."

I slowly moved underneath the archway, feeling the thick carpet underneath my sandals, scanning a room of dull light. The room was super long and rich black colored in front of the Regulator as I could not see a rear wall in the far distance. On each side of the wall, there were an individual set of transparent booths which were made of solid glass, without occupants of animals or humans, alive or dead. I slowly moved behind the back spine of my granny and whispered for my eardrums only, "A floor of black colored carpet, good for red blood stains and jumpy dog fleas."

The columns of four Regulators moved ahead in silence into the room.

Each booth was empty of an object. Then the next glass booth showed a group of people. The people were dressed in the same color of sky blue, consisting of female evening gowns and male tuxedoes. On the front illuminated colored screen, there was a picture of Jackie and Jamie.

Henoana turned and gasped at the wall of glass which showed the Zulu Time hostesses of Jackie and Jamie. "O goodness, this is the live broadcast of Zulu Time which is occurring right now."

Segue turned and stared into each transparent booth with a smile. "Really? Let's stop and watch!"

Oltole leaned over and wrapped an aqua colored glove around his mouth with a sour frown. "Shush, Segue. No talking."

Genic hugged his wife closer into his aqua colored tuxedo jacket with a smile. "It's okay, dear. We are meeting Ucal here. That's all. We have to see the muck and slime this time, only this time. Then we..."

Henoana turned and lifted a glove to her lips with a gasp at the object.

I dropped my mouth and stared at the objects too.

Laddie leaned over with a smile and a nod, jabbing an aqua gloved finger at the objects. "Lookie, lookie at the big dollies! Can I play with one? Can I have one too?" There was a line of low flying black colored medical hover cots, where a single body rested on top of the black metal without a covered sheet. Each body was covered in a set of tan and red tape, except sometimes, where the red or tan tap had turned black colored.

Oltole grabbed and gently turned the face of Laddie to see the side wall of solid black. "Look, there're pink ponies on the wall over here, Laddie."

Laddie turned with a smile to see a black wall of glass inside the empty glass cages as her tiny eyeballs darted away from the row of hovering medical cots with an individual dead body scanning for the pink ponies on the wall. "Where? Where? I don't see them. Where, Granny?" She smiled with a nod.

The medical cots slowly moved over the black carpet, actually dripping down a moving line of blood proteins over the material as the red blood proteins hit down into the carpet and then carpet quickly absorbed the bright redness into the blackness of the thick fabric.

I grabbed my mouth and my stomach at the same time, turning a face to see the row of dark wall of glass screen too, closing my eyelashes. The line of medical cots represented a line of the freshly killed criminals by the Vee team during the beginning seventh hour of the evening, the first match inside Zulu Time. That was the only way a line of floating medical cots with a black, red, and tan colored taped body would be tarrying back to the Cee building for plopping down into a one-family grave hole of white colored marble.

And my naked toes were walking over the dried blood of the dead and marble buried bodies of Cee Building. I marched with both my sandals into the air, missing every nasty dry fabric strand and gasped in shock.

The next glass booth on the left side of the wall contained a group of people that stood around or sat on the carpet which seemed to be locked inside the glass room. The people represented a family unit, a dad, a mom, a set of grandparents, and the children and a couple of teens. They were dressed in the same color of fancy gowns and tuxedos of green. The new family was huddled in a circle, waving their arms, pointing at the active wall of glass with moving lips and silent words.

I gasped at the sound proof booth, following behind my family, passing by a second glass room, where a second family unit of both parents and children too was located and dressed in the color of brown. Then I realized that the hallway was a holding stage for the Cee teams of criminals. I turned to my right to see numerous set of individual glass booths against an individual wall of glass, without a set of people.

I turned back to my left, seeing a new glass booth that was empty.

The Regulator halted and turned, moving toward the empty booth and touched an index finger into the glass door. A single slender tall door opened outwardly. The Regulator back stepped and turned sideways without communication.

Genic turned and shoved his wife into that slender door of the completely glass room and then followed behind her dress train. Oltole followed behind Genic and shoved Segue and Laddie through the narrow opening one at a time.

I turned and slowly moved inside a few inches from the open archway. The glass room was very quiet, without noise or music.

The glass door closed and sealed in silence, blowing a puff of warm air over my body. I stood directly in front of the door inside a glass room in total fright as my kneecaps shook, staring at a dark wall of glass.

"Why's the glass wall black? I thought this was Zulu Time. Where's the power into the tan colored room? Is this the real Zulu Time?" Segue marched and touched the black glass with both black colored gloves.

The verdict and the sentence had been carried out a few minutes before, thus a line of floating medical cots with an individual dead body. The room in Zulu Time was being cleaned up with the array of exposed weapons and the winners were being escorted off the campus, making a new room for the next justification case.

Oltole moving ahead and stopped, standing inside one of the four wall corners, kneeling down on the soft thick carpet with a back spine against the wall of glass, patting her kneecaps with a smile. "Laddie, come over here. Please, play paddy cake with me."

Laddie turned with a grin and moved ahead in front of her granny, sitting on the floor crossed legs to touch the hands of her granny, "Paddy cake. Paddy cake..."

"Wow, Mom, look at this. It's many peeker viewers." Segue back stepped with a grin and a giggle, pointing at each exposed peeker viewer. The entire wall opened up and revealed in a row a set of individual bloated human outlines.

I turned to see the dark wall of glass in shock. There were eight individual bloated human slots that might must two feet wide for a twenty-foot wall and each slot was empty but glowed in black twinkles of faint light.

"No" Genic shook his skull. "We are leaving..."

She nodded with a smile. "Yes, go on, Segue! But do not take off any of your clothing. You must wear the funny looking clothes into Zulu Time, too. Or you will be in some serious trouble." Henoana leaned over with a sour frown into the cheekbone of Genic. "I would rather have Segue inside the peeker viewer numbed rather than whining and crying, in case we are presented in Zulu Time. If he sees..."

"Fine," Genic turned and shoved his son into the open upright slot that was shaped like a bloated human. "Get inside, Segue. You can't come out until the door opens."

Segue ran ahead with a grin and entered the open slot with a laugh. "Yeah, yeah, I know. I will. I am." The door closed behind his back spine.

Genic and Henoana turned with a sour frown and moved closer into Igala, almost kissing each one of her cheekbones with a set of sour breath. Henoana growled into the nose profile of her eldest daughter. "Why are we here, Igala?"

I exhaled with a puff of worry. "Ucal, he is not involved anymore."

"Yes, he will fix this. We will be out shortly." Genic nodded with a smile. "He will appear in a few more minutes..."

"No. Ucal paid the repair cost." I exhaled. "I saw...I mean that I have figured out that all of this is a mistake."

Henoana growled into the cheekbone of Igala. "Yes, it is a mistake for us."

I exhaled with a puff of fear that my parents might attack and beat me up if they found out that we were really going into Zulu Time for a justification case. So I thought it better to lie and see how it all turns out. If we lived, then it was good. If we died, I didn't get punished. I whispered into each nose profile of my parents with a fake smile. "Look, I found another girl named Igee Smith. Are we blood-related to her somehow? Her name is below my name inside the Society City Four registry. So she is the guilty party here." I tapped and pinged on my com-d, displaying the names on the screen and lifted and flipped the screen to show my parents.

Genic nodded with a smile, jabbing a finger at the screen in silence, since his wife was the real man of the house. Henoana sneered into the cheekbone of Igala. "How did you figure this out, Igala?"

I smiled with a nod. "Well, one, I am not guilty of a second car accident. The Regulator came today. I didn't drive my car today. I drive my car, yesterday. And I didn't have an accident or bump. I promise. Two, I found this name Igee below my name, making this all a mistake for our Smith family unit..."

"This is all a mistake." Genic nodded with a smile, reaching and patting the gloved arm of Igala.

Henoana turned and sneered at the nose profile of her husband. "How will we get home, Genic? We're all stuck inside a four-walled enclosed glass room. I don't see anyone breaking down the glass for a rescue or opening the door for freedom."

I raised both palms with a stern face and a serious tone, knowing the real truth.

Minki tattled about Igala and the car accident to the Regulator. The Regulator had accessed the satellite feed and verified the accident, the driver, and the passenger. Zulu Time was set up to punish the criminal for a crime which Igala and her entire family could be guilty of and then Minki would reap the assets of the Smith family home.

However, Ucal was smarter than Minki and hated her guts, so he had given Igala another secret buzz word to save her life, Tag.

Then Igala and her family would go home and forgot that Zulu Time ever existed.

I whispered. "I wanna run and tattle to a Regulator, but I couldn't find one..."

Henoana turned and sneered into the cheekbone of Igala. "There was a line of them around the walls of the dance hall at five o'clock for almost a full hour. Why didn't you tattle then, Igala?"

Genic reached out and patted the gloved hand of his wife with a smile. "Listen to Igala, Henoana." He was too close to each face to nod with approval of Igala's finding.

I whispered. "If I did that, the Regulator might not believe me, confessing during a fun social dance. Then I would have been in trouble for lying to a Regulator..."

"Igala is both pretty and wise. She is correct. You did not lie, purposefully or accidentally." Genic turned and smiled to Igala.

I exhaled. "So we must enter Zulu Time..."

"No." Henoana wrapped both arms around a body, turning with a pair of lightly moist eyeballs to see her five-year-old daughter Laddie on the floor. If they went into Zulu Time and the viewer audience didn't believe their fairy tale, then they all would die.

I exhaled with a whisper. "Mom, if we enter Zulu Time, then the Vee team will see that we are not the Igee Smith and her family members. So we can also claim that we don't know them too..."

"Thus, they will die instead of us." Genic frowned.

"I don't know." I exhaled.

"I don't care." Henoana growled. "This is a Regulator mistake."

Genic dropped open and closed a mouth. "But it is not a Vee team mistake. This will be an interesting justification case."

Henoana turned and sneered into the nose bridge of Genic. "We are the justification case here."

A line of people in the turquoise colored formal attire passed by the booth of Igala and her family as Henoana lifted a glove to her mouth.

I slowly turned to see the line. The other unknown family unit marched, coming out from an unlocked and open booth glass in proper order of height, largest down towards tiniest. There was a dad, a mom, an elderly grandfather, an elderly grandmother, a tall sister, another short sister, and a two-year-old sister. The short sister was holding the tiny hand of the walking cute faced toddler.

The glass room of the Smith family was sound proof.

I could not hear a grunt, a whine, a sneer, or a single word, coming from the marching parade of turquoise colored unfamiliar people, but I could see that their lips were moving with a set of syllables.

The paraded turned the wall corner and disappeared from the long hallway of glass rooms.

Henoana gasped. "Zulu Time is starting." She swung around, seeing the wiggling lines on the wall of glass. The wall of glass showed the Zulu Time room, a tan colored continuous wall with a straight wall in the front without any bodies.

The two voices of Jackie and Jaime said in unison on the wall of glass, "Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!"

08:08 pm (early evening)

Interior tan colored room in Zulu Time

Warm temperatures and cloudy sky

A set of two doors opened on two different side walls again.

A pale skinned female exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female exited from the second side door as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile and a hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jackie and Jaime Jones."

Jackie slowly twirled in a tight circle in a body fitting sheath dress of amethyst purple with a face and a neck of red and yellow lady bug facial designs and a blonde ponytail of rainbow colors with a smile and a nod to see each glass screen. "I am Jackie. Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice. We will explain the rules for any new audience viewers. When an injustice has occurred, each party is presented here at the Zulu Time building."

Jaime slowly twirled in a tight circle, wearing an A-line ankle-length topaz colored gown as her face and her neck fluttered with a set of hollowed outlines of blue and red hawk-like facial designs. Her black hair draped down a back spine with a rainbow of wiggling colored lines. "I am Jamie. Then each party is allowed to voice their justification case within a twenty-second time limit in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your supper time meal. After the twenty seconds has ended, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for criminal or the letter of V for victim."

Then each female spun around with a smile and a nod and moved back to a closed door.

The Cee team doorway slid opened first.

Jamie swung around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of seven people in front of a long bench of soft tan colored fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind the back spine of Jaime and scanned the room with a set of smiles, finger pointing around the room, wearing formal attire in the color of turquoise. Each face was decorated with a solid black color human body part of an upright middle finger which was surrounded by an outline of two knuckles.

The Vee team doorway slid open next.

Jackie spun around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of six people in front of the same bench of soft beige fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind the back spine of Jackie and scanned the room with a set of mumbles and grunts, finger pointing to each tiny television plasma screen on the curved wall, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of violet color. Each face was decorated with a set of colorful hearts.

Jamie and Jackie turned and met in middle with a smile and a nod, twirling in a tight circle with a hand wave to see each glass screen too.

Jackie stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of soft violet. My twin sister Jamie stands behind the Cee team. The Vee team claims that the father of the large family was given a medication dosage by his personal and trustworthy physical for pain. Now, the father is dying of a terminal disease and will cease to live within two months. The family demands just and justice. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team."

Jamie stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile, speaking into an old fashioned microphone. "I am Jamie. I stand behind the Cee team of cool turquoise. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty seconds time period. Since each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jackie turned with a smile and handed the microphone to the father in the first position of the row of the Vee team as her sister Jamie turned and handed her microphone to the male in the first position of the row to the Cee team. They back stepped from the bench and stood inside an empty spot on the wall, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The father of the Vee team wore a violet colored tuxedo with a dark green bowtie and a pair of matching hand gloves and a body parts on the face, the neck, and the collar bone of a set of outlined red, purple, green, and yellow hearts. He jabbed a finger at the male with a sneer as he barely heard the musical whistle of the hearts on a painted face. The fun face paint sung and moved with the bones of the face. "He poisoned me into death. I was sick and went to my physician. Now, I am dead in two months. I can't stop the disease. It possesses all my organs. I will die and never see my sons and daughter grow and marry. So you and your family will die first. That will be my reward, sucker." He laughed with an evil grin.

The male of the Cee team wore a turquoise colored tuxedo with a crimson red bowtie and a pair of matching hand gloves and a solid black outline of a middle finger on one cheek. The male and his entire family unit turned to the side and exposed a decorated cheekbone toward the family of the Cee team with a smirk. The cheekbone twitched as the middle finger flexed up and down with a fart-like sound. Then the physician and his biological family turned back with a smile to see the Cee team family. The male smiled into the microphone. "I am physician. I save a life, not take a life. I prescribed a pill of medication for your severe pains for many years. You have a terminal disease. Nothing can stop a terminal disease but death." He chuckled. "Thus, you will die before me, sir."

The room went black as the voices faded into silence.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie smiled within the darkness in unison. "The twenty second deadline has expired.

The voice of Jackie smiled within the darkness. "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only."

The voice of Jaime smiled within the darkness. "If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie smiled within the darkness in unison. "Please illuminate all the glass screens now inside Zulu Time."

All the tiny glass screens showed a black back ground with one single letter in white.

The voice of Jamie smiled in the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Geez, I am astounded. Are your astounded, Jackie?"

The voice of Jackie smiled in the darkness too, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Wow, I am astonished. Are you astonished, too, Jamie?"

The voices of Jackie and Jaime smiled within the darkness in unison, "The highest mathematical number wins the justification case inside the Zulu Time room which is the letter C for the criminal team."

The tiny lights of millions of glass screens went dark. The dark room echoed in a series of screams and curses plus the sounds of rips and tears of fabric. Then, the room was silence.

At few seconds later, the overhead lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room.

On the forward wall, there were six objects that stood in height from tallest down towards shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages, cascading down from the hair roots to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

In front of the long bench, the winning Cee team with the male physician stood in the middle of a circle of his biological family unit, whispering and talking. Then he turned and moved to the first object on the forward wall.

Jackie twirled around in a tight circle with a smile to see each glass screen on the curved wall. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, each Cee team member must participate and accept the judgment. Thus, the Vee team has lost the justification case. Now, each Vee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of tan and the pretty color of red against the forward wall for justice. Each Vee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment too. Thus, the Vee team is sentenced to death by means of the Cee team's fun and creative methods on the wall of criminals."

Jamie swirled around in a tight circle with a smile to see each glass screen on the curved wall. "Cee team, please select your pleasure. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. Pick out whatever suites your heart and your hand. This part of Zulu Time is choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Cee team member must fire one weapon at one oval shaped object and kill the wiggling object on the forward wall. A Cee team member will know a kill shot has occurred when the oval shaped object has turned into the color of rich black, covering the tan or red tape. And I do believe that our evening audience is filled with people the love their physician for the win tonight."

The other family members of the Cee team moved sideways and stopped, standing in front of an oval shaped object as the object wiggled side to side, sounding in a set of low, deep moans like a ghost.

Inside the peeker viewer, a set of low, deep moans echoed into the eardrums of Segue as he stood with a nose bridge and a pair of gloves against the cool glass with a smile of intrigue. "This is so cool."

Each Cee team member reached down and slapped the lid with a hand as the lid lifted and displayed an array of deadly weapons.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue stood upright on his tippy toes, trying to see inside the deep chest of the long bench that was really a storage cabinet of deadly weapons, but he was too short. He didn't bring the com-d, because of his parents, which could have viewed and magnified a weapon or two inside the cabinet for his eyeballs and his friends. His snobby friends were going to be so jealous that he was here to see and feel the upcoming death action.

Then each Cee member reached down and selected a different weapon, standing upright with a stern face and an armful of weapons to see the intended target, an oval shape with a set of tan and red tape against the forward wall. The physician reached up and slapped the lid. The lid closed shut. Then each member dropped the weapons down over the soft fabric of the long bench.

Jackie smiled at the wall of criminals. "There are too many objects on the forward wall. That is not a prob, thou. Each Cee team member has a weapon and is standing in front of one object. Thus, each Cee team member will hit the object until the red tape turns into the color of black.

Jaime smiled at the wall of criminals. "However, the last Cee team group of three individuals is composed of the three sisters. The sisters are two teenagers and a toddler. The toddler here inside the Zulu Time room is too young to shoot a weapon, thus the toddler is exempt from firing a weapon at an oval shaped object. The Zulu Time rule states that the weapon must be held by a person at the age of four years old and older. This justification case cannot be completed until all the objects have turned black. And the team member will start with the largest object on the forward wall. Regulators are not required to assist any of the Cee team. Let's hustle without the music to the door, Jamie." She spun around with a smile and dashed toward the open archway of the Cee team hallway inside the Zulu Time hallway.

"I'm hustling without the music to the door, Jackie." Jamie swung around with a smile and dashed to the opposite side of the wall into a dark archway.

Jackie and Jaime spun around and stood inside the separate archways for safety with a smile and a nod in unison. "Aim high..."

Then both the doors closed and shut.

The first Cee team member was the physician male with a solid black middle finger on his cheekbone, wearing the turquoise tuxedo with a pair of crimson hand gloves and a matching bowtie, reaching down and grabbed a silver-tinted dagger with a sparkling jeweled hilt. He posed the dagger sideways against his chest, swinging a cupped hand out to the side and around the back spine, flinging the arm forward, releasing the dagger. The dagger twirled sideways over the air waves and hit the tan color tape at the throat of the male.

Segue smiled. "Wow, that move is so cool. I wished I could twirl a sideways dagger too."

"Gah..." The voice of the male, the largest object on the wall of criminals continued to groan with pain as the tan colored body jerked side to side in pain.

Segue slammed a head forward into the glass, falling down on his kneecaps and covered his ears, biting his tongue into blood as the low painful moan of the largest oval shape pierced into his eardrums, "Geez, too real." He sat back on his kneecaps, holding both eardrums with a smile of the death event, leaning into the cool glass again.

The first Cee team member, the physician reached down and grabbed a second dagger, lifting and posed the dagger in front of his chest, whipping a right tossing arm behind the body, releasing the dagger. The dagger twinkled underneath the artificial lamps through in the air waves, turning sideways and hit the red colored tape at the heart of the largest object on the wall of criminals.

Segue smiled with a set of covered ears. "Whoa."

"Waah..." The voice of the male, the first object on the wall of criminals finally moaned over the air waves as the tan colored taped turned black. His arms and limbs jumped up and down and then finally shivered in death.

Segue smiled with a set of covered ears. "Too much, he died. He really died. He isn't moving any more. And the tape has turned black at his heart. Wow."

The physician male turned with a smile and a nod to the see the adult female, the second Cee team member.

The second Cee team member, an adult female wore a solid black middle finger on her cheekbone, reaching down and grabbed a silver-tinted dagger with a sparkling jeweled hilt. She stood with her jeweled sandals apart inside the ankle-length turquoise sparkling gown, gritting her teeth and posed the dagger sideways against her chest also, swinging a cupped hand out to her left side and around her back spine, flinging her arm forward and released the dagger.

Segue frowned with a set of covered ears. "Ugh, she missed. Her husband is the best pitcher."

The dagger twirled sideways over the air waves and hit the tan color tape at the leg of the female.

"Iyhiih..." The voice of the female, the second object on the wall of criminals screamed in searing pain as the tan colored tape turned into black, but she was not dead.

Segue slammed his head forward into the glass again, busting his lips as the high-pitched scream continued inside the peeker viewer and invaded both eardrums. "No. Stop. Stop screaming." He dropped down and stood on both kneecaps, holding his eardrums, tucking a chin into his chest and closed both eyelids. "Stop, stop screaming..."

The adult female of the Cee team smiled with a nod, lifting a second dagger into her chest and whipped it around the body and released the weapon. The dagger sparkled underneath the lights, twirling sideways and hit the red tape on the forehead of the female.

"Pfft..." The voice of the female, the second object on the wall of criminals softly moaned in pain as the red colored tape turned into black and then she breathed her last breath.

Segue looked up with a worried brow and opened one eyeball, seeing the non-moving oval shape. "Woo. Okay. Yeah. That's wasn't so bad after all. She's dead too."

The adult female turned with a smile and a nod to see her elderly father, leaving the other unused weapons on top of the bench.

The third Cee team member, the elderly grandfather wore a solid black middle finger on his cheekbone and a turquoise tuxedo with a pair of crimson hand gloves and a matching bowtie, lifting and aimed a tiny electric crossbow near the nose bridge at the short oval shaped object, which looked like a teenager. He fired continuously an array of short and sharp pointy arrow tips into the skull, the center of the rib cage, the stomach, and the right leg as the tan and red colored tape turned all black.

Segue smiled. "Whoa. He's good."

"Uoo..." The voice of the teenage male, the third object on the wall of criminals briefly screamed in high-pitched pain as the red colored tape on the skull turned into rich black that was followed by the black coloring of the rib cage, the stomach, and the right leg.

Segue grabbed both eardrums again with a smirk. "That was good and fast. I hardly heard a scream."

The elderly grandfather released the trigger of the cross bow, dropping the weapon down to the soft fabric of the bench and turned with a smile and a nod to see his wife, an elderly grandmother of the grandmother and the mother of the wife on the Cee teams.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue raised an arm with a smile. "Go, go, grandma. I gotta a grandma too. I wonder if she would kill..." He turned with a gasp to see the solid glass door and turned back with a worried brow. "No."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the fourth Cee team member, the elderly grandmother wore a solid black middle finger on her cheekbone, standing apart inside the turquoise colored evening gown, lifting and aimed another tiny electric crossbow at a short oval shaped object, which appeared like a teenager. She fired continuously a single short and sharp pointy arrow tip into the red taped region that represented the bone skull of the fourth object on the wall of criminals.

"Eek..." The teenager male softly squeaked in pain, the fourth object on the wall of criminals and as, his four limbs of arms and legs lifted up and down, slamming into the back wall. The red colored tape turned into rich black colors.

Inside the peeker viewer, "Ouch," Segue stood upright and looked down at both legs inside the aqua colored tuxedo without see the forming bruises but felt the pain and spun around with a confused brow to the glass door. "What happened? What hit me? O no! The air-punch hit me. O no! The kid hit the wall and the air-punch did the same thing as the other night inside our home peeker viewer. I want out now." He slammed on the glass door with two fists and a sissy yell. "Out, I wanna get out, Mom, Dad, Igala. I want out."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the fourth Cee team member, the elderly grandmother the trigger on the cross bow, dropping the weapon back down to the soft fabric of the bench and turned with a smile and a nod to see her three granddaughters.

The fifth Cee team member, the tallest of her granddaughters wore a solid black middle finger on her cheekbone and an evening gown of turquoise with a pair of matching gloves and sandal, standing alone in front of the bench. Her other two sisters stood against the wall behind her back spine for safety.

Inside the peeker, viewer, Segue exhaled with a huff of fear with a yell. "I want out, Mom." He looked back over a collar bone, seeing the teenage girl.

The tallest granddaughter nodded to her grandmother to complete the death act and turned to see the shortest oval shaped object on the forward wall, spreading apart a pair of sandaled feet in front of the bench. She lifted and twirled a rounded black colored metal ball with a long metal golden chain around her hair roots in a couple of completed circles and then released it.

Segue gasped. "What's that?" He spun around and moved back to the glass window, placing both gloves and his nose bridge on the cool glass again with a grin.

The ball sailed through the air waves and hit the chest of the smallest oval shaped with a sounding thud.

"Ooo..." The oval shape of the child, the fifth and last object oval on the wall of criminals screamed in pain. The tan colored did not turn black as the child continued to wail in pain and terror, flinging the arms and the legs up and down, slamming against the back wall.

Segue fell down on the glass floor onto both kneecaps and covered both eardrums, curling into a ball of pain while developing a set of blue colored bruises from each air-punch. "Ouch. Ouch. Stop. It hurts. My body, please stop the pain..."

The sixth Cee member moved ahead from the back wall and wore a turquoise ankle-length gown with a pair of waist gloves and a pair of matching shoes, stopping and stood in front of the bench. She reached down and lifted, twirling the new ball and chain weapon around a set of sparkling hair roots of colored glitter in a few completed circles and then released the weapon. The ball flew through the air waves and hit the red colored tape of the skull.

"Pfft..." the child softly moaned in pain of a final death and as, the red colored tape turned into rich black.

Then the room went black.

The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "It is done."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "I hoped that you have enjoyed the evening program, so far."

The voice of Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "The night is still young and fresh. Sit back and stay tuned for more Zulu Time."

All the closed peeker viewer doors slid opened at once.

Segue tumbled out and over the black carpet with a gasp, falling onto his nose and stood upright on both kneecaps with a stream of tears and a smears of blood over a sweaty face.

Henoana turned and gasped with worry. "Segue?"

Oltole sat on the floor and hid the wall of glass from Laddie, playing another hand game to entertain the child without seeing the Zulu Time event.

I stood beside the glass door, staring with a numb body at Segue.

"Fine," He spun around with a smile and wiped off the sweat and the blood from stained face, seeing his mom. "Wow, it...it was..."

"Enough, Segue!" Henoana frowned at her son.

Segue thumbed back over a collar bone with a grin and a nod. "I wanna go back inside the peeker viewer." He spun around with a smile and moved back toward a different peeker viewer without permission.

Henoana reached out patted the hand of her husband with a sour frown. "It is all right. I want him entertained, not worried." She turned and gasped at the moving objects behind a back spine. A line of people in the brown colored formal attire exited from the glass cage and moved beside the glass booth of Igala and her family. Henoana lifted a glove to her mouth with a sob of worry and fright.

I slowly spun around with a worried brow to see the line of people in brown colors. The family unit marched from an unlocked and open booth glass in proper order of height, largest down towards tiniest. There was a dad, a mom, an elderly grandfather, a tall mature brother, another short teen brother, and a sister. The glass cage of the Smith family was sound proof, thus I could hear a grunt, a whine, a sneer, or a single word from the marching parade of brown colored clothed of unfamiliar people.

I dropped a face down into my pair of the long elbow gloves, feeling the soft satin, wiping off some of the cute colorful white star designs on my skin and held back my tears, not the sobs. I didn't want to see the family parade of real and breathing people, who would live or die within a few more minutes from now. I whispered with a sob. "I am going to die..."

The parade of brown colored clothes turned the wall corner and disappeared from the hallway of glass rooms.

Genic spun around with a gasp to see hallway with a whisper for his eardrums only. "It's empty. The entire hallway with the other glass rooms is empty."

Henoana gasped. "We are next in Zulu Time." She swung around, seeing the black colored wall of glass with a worried brow.

On the wall of glass, Jackie and Jaime smiled within the darkness in unison, "Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!"

Then a set of wiggling brown and yellow lines formed over the wall of glass. Then the wall illuminated and showed the Zulu Time room, a tan colored continuous wall with a straight forward wall without any mounted bodies.

At 09:09 pm (mid-evening) inside the tan colored Zulu Time room with outside warm temperatures and night sky of light rain, the twin Zulu Time hostesses stood inside an archway within the darkness, "Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!"

A set of two doors opened on two different side walls.

A pale skinned female exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female exited from the second side door as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile and a hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jackie and Jamie Jones."

Jackie slowly twirled around in a tight circle in the same dress and facial designs with a smile to see each glass screen. "I am Jackie. Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice. We will explain the rules for any new audience attendees. When an injustice has occurred, each party is presented here at the Zulu Time building."

Jaime slowly whirled around in a tight circle in the same dress and facial designs with a smile to see each glass screen. "I am Jamie. Then each party is allowed to voice their justification case within the twenty second deadline in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your supper time meal. After the twenty seconds has ended, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for criminal or the letter of V for victim."

Then each female spun around with a smile and moved back to a closed door.

The Cee team doorway slid open first.

Jamie swung around away from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of six people in front of the low and long bench of soft beige fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of mumbles and grunts, turning and pointing to each tiny television plasma screen on the curved wall, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of brown color. Each face was decorated with a solid yellow colored alligator jaw line of colored sharp pointy fangs.

The Vee team doorway slid open next.

Jackie spun around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of four people in front of the same long bench of soft fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind the back spine of Jackie and scanned the room and the opposing party with a set of sneers, finger pointing on the other side of the room, wearing formal attire in the color of grey with a set of hollowed outlines of colorful wildlife animal figures, such like, a duck, a swam, and a rabbit on the face and the naked arms of the women.

Jamie and Jackie spun around and met in middle with a smile and a nod, twirling in a tight circle with a hand wave to see each glass screen too.

Jackie stopped the swirl and raised an arm with a smile, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of smooth grey. My twin sister Jamie stands behind to Cee team. The Vee team claims that the next door neighbors harass all the time, each and every nice family member, coming home from work, going to church, heading to the grocery store. The mean and rude family of the Cee team will not stop with the name calling. So, this family demands just and justice. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team."

Jamie stopped the twirl and raised an arm with a smile, speaking into an old fashioned microphone. "I am Jamie. I stand behind the Cee team in the color of brown. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty-second time period. Since each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jackie turned with a smile and handed the microphone to the female in the first position of the column of the Vee team as her sister Jamie turned and handed her microphone to the male in the first position of the row of the Cee team. They back stepped from the bench and the two debating teams, standing along the empty space on the wall, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The adult middle-aged mother of the Vee team wore an off-the-shoulder grey plantation gown with a set of matching long elbow length gloves. Her exposed body parts, consisting of a face, a neck, a collar bone, and both arms, showed a set of hollowed outlined red, purple, green, and yellow swans. She pressed one glove down the gown with a soft whisper and a smile as she heard the sweet song of each swam on a painted face into the microphone. The fun face paint sung and moved with the bones of her face. "That older child of that family continues to call my sweet boy a set of nasty names..."

The adult middle-aged male of the Cee team wore a brown colored tuxedo with an amber bowtie and a pair of matching hand gloves. His face showed a solid colored yellow alligator head of an open mouth of colorful fangs. He shouted at the mother into the microphone, jabbing a finger at each family member. "Nigger. Nigger. Nigger..."

The other family members of the Cee team joined the shout and jabbed a finger at each face of the Vee team in unison, repeating the nasty slur, "Nigger. Nigger. Nigger..."

The male of the Cee team changed the word, "Bitch. Bitch. Bitch..."

The other family members of the Cee team changed the chant, shouting and jabbed a finger at each face of the Vee team in unison, repeating the nasty slur, "Bitch. Bitch, Bitch..."

The male of the Cee team changed the word, "Bastard. Bastard. Bastard..."

The other family members of the Cee team changed the chant, shouting and jabbed a finger at each face of the Vee team in unison, repeating the nasty slur, "Bitch. Bitch. Bitch..."

The mother of the Vee team dropped open a mouth and tried to speak inside her microphone a single word, except the loud chanting would not stop.

The male of the Cee team changed the word, "Cunt. Cunt. Cunt..."

The other family members of the Cee team changed the chant, shouting and jabbed a finger at each face of the Vee team in unison, repeating the nasty slur, "Cunt. Cunt. Cunt..."

The male of the Cee team changed the word, "Whore. Whore. Whore..."

The other family members of the Cee team changed the chant, shouting and jabbed a finger at each face of the Vee team in unison, repeating the nasty slur, "Whore. Whore. Whore..."

The room went black as the voices faded into silence.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue gasped with a nod and a sour frown. "The Cee people are truly mean and cruel." He reached down for the wrist to feel a naked arm, leaving the com-d inside the Cee chamber room per his mom's instructions. He smiled at the Cee team members. "If I could vote, I'd vote for you, poor mother, father, and your sweet children. You would win. Then you can slaughter and kill the mean criminals..."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The twenty seconds deadline has expired."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only."

The voice of Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl."

The voices of Jackie and Jamie said with a smile within the darkness. "Please illuminate all the glass screens now inside Zulu Time."

All the tiny glass screens showed a black back ground with one single letter in white.

The voice of Jamie gasped within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "O might, Jackie!"

The voice of Jackie gasped within the darkness too, seeing all the illuminated screens. "O goodness, Jamie!"

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said within the darkness in unison, "The highest mathematical number wins the justification case inside the Zulu Time room which is the letter C for the criminal team."

The lights from each tiny glass screen went black.

The dark room echoed in a series of loud screams and harsh curses plus the sounds of soft rips and loud tears of fabric. Then the room was silent. The lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room.

On the forward wall, there were four objects that stood in height from tallest down towards shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages, cascading from the hair roots to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue gasped in shock through the glass window. "No, no, that's not possible. The Vee people are nice and sweet like my granny and my mom and my dad..."

The winning Cee team turned and moved sideways spreading out across the long bench in front of an individual oval shaped body of the Vee team as each object slightly wiggled side to side, sounding in a low deep groan like a ghost.

Inside the peeker viewer, a set of low deep moans echoed into the eardrums of Segue. He covered both ears with a sour frown. "I hate that sound. It sounds like a ghost inside a haunted house."

Jackie twirled around in a tight circle with a smile to see each glass screen. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, each Cee team member must participate and accept the judgment. Thus, the Vee team has lost the justification case. Now, each Vee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of beige and the pretty color of red against the rear wall for justice. Each Vee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment too. Thus, the Vee team is sentenced to death by means of the Cee team's fun and creative methods on the wall of criminals."

Jamie swirled around in a tight circle with a smile to see each glass screen. "Cee team, please select your pleasure. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. Pick out whatever suites your heart and your hand. This part of Zulu Time is choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Cee team member must fire one weapon at one oval shaped object and kill the wiggling object on the forward wall. A Cee team member will know a kill shot has occurred when the oval shaped object has turned into the color of rich black, covering the tan or red tape. And I do believe that our evening audience is filled with a batch of mean bullies that symbolized the Cee team win tonight."

Each Cee team member reached down and slapped the lid with a hand as the lid lifted and displayed an array of deadly weapons.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue stood in place with a set of covered ears, looking with a sad face at the row of wiggling oval shaped figures of adults and children on the wall of criminals with a whisper. "They should have won the match, not these ugly bullies. I bet my snobby friends voted for the bullies to be mean, too, since they're jealous of nice folks like...like my parents."

Inside the Zulu Time room, each Cee member reached down and selected a different weapon, standing upright with a stern face and a hand gun to see the intended target, an oval shape with a set of tan and red tape against the rear wall.

Jackie stopped the whirl and stared with a smile at the wall of criminals. "There are too many objects on the forward wall. That is not a prob, thou. Each Cee team member has a weapon and is standing in front of one object. Thus, each Cee team member will hit the object until the red tape turns into the color of rich black. However, the last Cee team member is a teenager male. O might, that teenager is holding a hand gun in each palm like a professional sharp shooter at the two targeted oval shaped figures.

Jaime stopped the swirl and stared with a smile at the wall of criminals. "The rules of Zulu Time state that a child as young as four years old must aim and fire a weapon. So, it is not against any of the Zulu Time rules, if a team member holds and handles two more weapons with both the hands. This justification case cannot be completed until all the objects have turned black. And the team member will start with the largest object on the forward wall. Regulators are required to assist all the Cee team members. Let's get outta of here, now, Jamie."

"I'm outta of here, now, Jackie." Jamie nodded with a smile.

Then each female spun around with a smile and dashed toward the opposite side of the wall into a dark archway.

A line of Regulators entered the room, coming from the criminal doorway, passing out a set of earplugs for the noise, clicking off the safety on each gun and turned in unison as one unit. They marched back into the open archway of the Cee team hallway.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue gasped in fright inside the Zulu Time room. "O no! They're using loud hand guns, not a soft sounding arrow or axe or anything like that. O no! I'm going to hear and feel their deaths, too." He spun around and slammed into the glass door of the peeker viewer, pounding with both gloves and a panicked brow of worry. "Open up. Get me out, now. Mom? Dad? Get me out..."

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jackie and Jaime swung around and stood inside the archway for safety with a smile and a nod in unison. "Aim high..."

Then both the doors closed down and shut tight.

The first Cee team member, the adult father wore a solid colored yellow alligator head of colored fangs, lifting and aimed the hand gun with a set of cupped fists and fired in a continuous array of bullets. The bullets fired one at a time and sailed one at a time through the air waves, hitting the skull, the neck, the heart, and other body parts of the largest oval shaped object on the wall of criminals.

"Argh..." The voice of the female, the first oval object on the wall of criminals briefed screamed with pain as the tan colored body jerked up, down, and sideways, coming from an array of bullets. Then all the red and tan colored taped turned rich black on every single part of the dead body.

Inside the peeker viewer, his body slammed and hit into the side wall from the air-punch of body bullets on the mother of the Vee team. Segue dropped down to both kneecaps over the glass floor, holding both eardrums from the loud sounds of the bullets, rolling side to side in the simulated pain of the dead body from the multiple air-punch hits over his body.

Inside the Zulu Time room, she lifted and aimed with a two-fisted hand gun, firing at the second object on the wall of criminals, without waiting for the head nod from her husband. The second Cee team member was the adult female with a solid red colored alligator head of colored fangs, standing in front of the first teen brother, the second object on the wall of criminals. She shot out an array of bullets at the skull, the neck, the heart, and followed the same line of body parts like her husband. She fired in a continuous array of bullets. The bullet fired one at a time and sailed one at a time through the air waves, hitting the skull, the neck, the heart, and other body parts of the second oval shaped object on the wall of the criminals.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue slammed a head side to side into the side glass walls, biting his tongue into blood as the air-punch molecules bombarded each body part, including both cheekbones, both hands, both arms, both legs, and both feet. He twirled and curled into a ball, rolling side to side in low painful moans, hiding a face with the tiny blood cuts as the numerous and hard air-punch molecules hit his back spine and his exposed neck muscles. He cried in pain with tears and screams, but it didn't stop.

Inside the Zulu Time room, "Waah," the voice of the teen male, the second object on the wall of criminals sounded in pain and as, the four limbs of the oval shaped jumped up, down, and sideways, hitting the rear wall. The red and tan colored taped turned rich black as the body shivered in death.

He lifted and aimed with two hand guns, firing at the two separate targets on the forward wall, without waiting for the head nod from his mother. The third Cee team member was the teen male with a solid green colored alligator head of colored fangs, standing in front of the brother and the sister of the Vee team, the third and fourth objects on the wall of criminals. He fired out an array of bullets at two sets of bone skulls and organ hearts, following the same line of body parts like his parents. He fired in a continuous array of bullets. The bullet fired one at a time and sailed one at a time through the air waves, hitting in order the skull, the neck, the heart, and other body parts at the third and fourth objects on the forward wall of criminals.

At one time, all four hand guns were blazing pretty white smoke and blasting an array of hard to see golden bullets at all the two bodies on the forward wall of criminals.

"Pfft...," the voice of the smallest oval shape on the wall of criminals, the female child softly moaned in pain and as, the all the tan and red colored tape turned into rich black. Then she breathed her last breath.

Inside the peeker viewer, Segue slammed a body into the wall, rolling side to side, covering his head, busting the lips in his own blood as the high-pitched scream continued inside the peeker viewer and invaded his eardrums. "No. Stop. Stop dying. Stop it..."

Inside the Zulu Time room, "Eek," the voice of the teen brother, the third object on the wall of criminals softly squeaked in pain and as, his four limbs of arms and legs lifted up and down, slamming back and forth into the rear wall, coming from the array of bullets of the teen male of the Cee team. And then all the red and tan colored tape turned into rich black.

Inside the peeker viewer, the back spine of Segue slammed into the locked glass door with a yell of pain, protecting most of his body but his arms and legs.

Then the Zulu Time room went black.

The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness in unison on the wall of glass. "It is done."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness on the wall of glass. "I hoped that you have enjoyed the evening program, so far."

The voice of Jaime said with a smile within the darkness of the wall of glass. "The night is still young and fresh. Sit back and stay tuned for more Zulu Time."

All the closed peeker viewer doors slid open at once.

Segue tumbled out and fell over the black carpet with a gasp, falling down onto a back spine and rolled upright on both kneecaps with a set of tears and sobs, and stood upright, running into his mom.

Henoana hugged his body with a worried brow and a whisper. "Segue!"

The glass door of the Smith family booth slid open.

The Regulator stood near the exit door, motioning with an index finger for the Smith family to exit out from the glass room in silence.

I spun around with a gasp of fear, staring at the non-emotional face of the Regulator.

Henoana swung around with a gasp of fear to see the coppery golden stern face of the Regulator too, hugging Segue.

Genic leaned down and aided Laddie and Oltole to stand upright, wearing a smile and nod. "It is going to be okay, Mother. Ucal is going..."

"When, Genic? When is Ucal coming? Where are...?" Oltole stood upright with a huff, grabbing and hugged Laddie into her evening gown, smearing the colorful dolly faces of her grandchild into the pretty aqua fabric. She frowned with worry as her red colored song birds sung in a happy musical tone.

Henoana squatted down to see Segue, wiping off most of the colorful race cars from his red tear-stained face with a stern face. "We need to leave..."

Segue looked up with a smile. "For home..."

"For..."

Segue stumbled backward from her stern face, yelling and crying, waving both wet gloves of smeared colored race cars. "No, no, they kill ya dead. They killed all the people on the wall, without mercy and with laughter. I saw it. I heard it. I feel it. They hate us..."

I sobbed with tears, holding a face between my satin gloves. Ucal was not coming to rescue me. This was not his problem. I had sentenced my family to death for a silly fender bender on my ancient car inside Zulu Time. I should had run to the Regulator and pleaded for mercy for my family. I didn't. It is too late, now.

"We leave now." Henoana stood upright with a firm voice and a stern face to see the Regulator, speaking to Oltole. "You hug and walk with Segue, too, Mother."

"Come to granny, sweetheart." Oltole lifted up and wiggled her gloved fingers.

Segue stood upright with a wobble, moving across the floor and ran into the long skirt of his granny, sobbing with tears of fright and fear of his upcoming death. He knew and read the rules of Zulu Time, without permission of his parents on the com-d, since it was free. Each team received a time limit of twenty seconds for talking and then the viewers of the com-ds decided the fate of the loser. His wild mental thoughts raved with worry and pain. Igala had hit the other car. She had been at fault and guilt. She should die, not Segue.

Genic spun around and scooted ahead, cuddling his wife with a smile and a nod into his jacket." Dear, Ucal is coming. Please have faith. He told Igala that he would come. I trust Ucal."

Henoana gritted her teeth and pulled back from his tender hug. "When, Genic?"

Genic turned with a smile and moved out the glass room first, since the single vertical and slender glass door only allowed one person at a time to exit the room, unless you were a small child. He led the line of the Smith family, following behind the back spine of the single Regulator.

Henoana wiped away her tears and turned with a sneer to see the nose profile of Igala. Her eldest daughter hid a face inside her gloves. "I go, next," she leaned over with a growl into the glove of Igala and moved through the glass door second.

I lifted a face and sniffed the nose snot back into my nostrils, wiping off some of the white powder and the eye tears with a shaky glove, touching a fluttering tummy of one thousand and one butterflies and felt more afraid rather than numb. I moved ahead through the slender door, seeing a black wall of glass ahead and turned toward the metal archway of the entrance door into Zulu Time, seeing the aqua colored chapel train of my mom's dress, without looking ahead. If I didn't look up and see anything, then nothing would happen to me. I nodded in silence down at the black carpet, seeking the large dark spots of fossilized human blood proteins and gasped, stopping before running into the dress train of my mom.

The Smith family parade in a single file toward the open archway was short, since they occupied the first glass booth inside the criminal hallway of Zulu Time.

The rows of glass booths down the single hallway were designed to intimidate and strike fear into the criminals for the upcoming Zulu Time match.

And it worked perfectly, folks.

10:10 pm (late evening)

Zulu Time room of tan hue

Outside warm temperatures and night sky of light rain

I stood behind my mom in order of family height which was associated with each age also that was a requirement of the Zulu Time rules. I didn't know all the Zulu Time rules, but I didn't worry about it now, too late for me and my family. I whispered for my eardrums only, fanning a heated face of tears and sobs with my glove, before I fainted and fell over the floor with a whisper for my eardrums only. "I am going to die..."

The row of Regulators didn't speak but elegantly pointed an index finger down at the spot for each criminal family member in silence which was in front of an open archway of bright lights inside the tan colored Zulu Time room.

There was no movement through the open archway inside the tan colored. My heart wanted to burst out from the middle of my chest. My mind went black. My pulse raced. My lungs slowed as I breathed in shallow gulps of air. My blood flowed swiftly through my veins as I felt dizzy to faint over my mom and then over a black carpet that didn't produce sound but showed darker spots of fossilized human blood proteins.

Then the open archway of the criminal side closed, tossing the entire hallway into darkness.

I gasped in fear, fidgeting in place. I wasn't afraid of the dark. I was afraid of dying without someone knowing the truth. It was a silly fender bender against an indestructible new model hover car. I didn't harm anyone. I didn't kill anyone with a weapon. I didn't do nothing but steer my ancient car around a hard pavement like a teenage from yesteryears.

The Zulu Time hostess named Jaime chanted in unison with her sister into a hand-held microphone with a whisper, since the microphone would re-broadcast her voice throughout the wall of glass screens into each home of Society City Four as she stood behind a closed door inside the darkness of the Cee criminal area. Her pretty evening dress didn't spark within the black color either, "Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!"

The criminal side door slid open along with the victim side door at the same time on two different side walls.

I lifted and shaded my sensitive eyelashes from the bright lights inside the Zulu Time room, seeing the twin sister Jackie inside her open archway, signaling in silence a smile and a nod to her sister Jaime.

Jackie was a pale skinned female, exiting from her archway. Jamie was a dark skinned female, exiting from the criminal archway as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile and a hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jackie and Jaime Jones."

Jackie slowly twirled around in a tight circle in the same pretty gown and the same lady bug designs with a smile and a nod to see each glass screen. "I am Jackie. Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice. We will explain the rules for any new audience attendees. When an injustice has occurred, each party is presented here at the Zulu Time building."

Jamie slowly twirled around in a tight circle in the same pretty gown and wore the same hawk facial design, smiling with a nod at each glass screen. "I am Jamie. Then, each party is allowed to voice their justification case within the twenty-second time period in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your supper time meal. After the twenty seconds ends, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for criminal or the letter of V for victim."

Then the criminal door closed with a thud.

My heart stopped and restarted with the heavy sound like a shotgun. I twisted both gloves around my fingers, around my arms, and around my body with fear and nervousness.

Inside the Zulu Time, room, each female spun around with a smile and moved back to a closed door.

Then the criminal door slid open for a third time.

Jamie approached with a smile and a nod towards Genic, the first person in the line of the Smith family and then spun around, moving away from Genic with the same frozen smile, leading a line of Genic, Henoana, Igala, and Oltole. Oltole hugged both Segue and Laddie to each side of her gown, slowly falling behind the pace of Igala. Laddie turned with a smile to study the curved wall of tan colored. Segue was crying with a sissy whine, wiping off the tears with a gloved hand.

The Smith family stopped and stood in front of a low long bench of soft beige fabric. The adult family members turned and scanned the curved walls of thousands of black glass screens that represented a registered com-d within Society City Four.

I slowly covered my parted lips with a gasp of the sheer volume of the tiny little black glass screens over the curved walls, coming down from ceiling to the floor that were watching my bad manners and my pretty dress.

Genic and Henoana stood together and slowly turned with a set of dropped open mouth in silence, surveying the curved wall and the numerous tiny little black glass screens too. The entire floor was a tan colored hard surface with a wall-to-wall long sitting bench which was covered in tan fabric. The bench rested one-fourth into the depth of the room. They turned and stared at the forward wall, seeing a cloth-like substance of tan colored with a series of thick horizontal tapes that held each upright body of the loser in Zulu Time.

Henoana covered her lips with a glove and a gasp, swiftly turning with a worried brow to see the other wall of tiny screens, closing her eyelashes to the horror of the moment inside Zulu Time.

Genic cuddled his wife with a smile and a whisper. "This is pretend, dear. Ucal will come really soon."

Oltole hugged both the children into her dress so tight that you couldn't see a face, only a set of fluttering strands of black hair roots as their colored face paint smeared and dirtied her aquamarine colored evening gown. She slowly turned to survey the numerous tiny little screens with a stern face. She really wanted to sneer and raise a folded fist in fury to the group of nasty and evil com-d viewers but feared that she might lose the only chance of good luck to win inside Zulu Time, where only one family would win. And other family will die, soonest.

Jackie spun around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of six people in front of the same long bench of soft fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room and the opposing party with a set of sneers, finger pointing on the other side of the room, wearing formal attire in the color of ruby red. Each face held a set of rounded symbols in the color of aquamarine, representing a single tire on an ancient car that belonged to Igala, the criminal of the crime.

Jamie and Jackie spun around and met in middle with a smile, twirling in a tight circle with a hand wave to see each glass screen.

Jackie stopped the twirl and raised an arm with a smile, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of furious red. My twin sister Jamie stands behind to Cee team. The Vee team claims that their daughter was involved and injured in a vicious careless automobile wreck over the hard flat pavement. Now, their daughter has extensive body injuries that will take forever to heal as she misses her cultural life with her loving family and her busy social life with her boyfriend. The family demands just and justice. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team."

Jamie stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile, speaking into an old fashioned microphone. "I am Jamie. I stand behind the Cee team in the color of pretty aquamarine. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty seconds timed deadline. Since each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jackie turned with a smile and handed the microphone to Minki in the first position of the column of the Vee team members as her sister Jamie turned and handed her microphone to the Henoana in the first position of the column of the Cee team members. They back stepped from the bench, standing along an empty spot on the wall, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

Minki accepted and held the microphone without an injured hand with an evil smirk, looking into the scared eyeballs of Igala across the floor. This was the final vengeance on her pretty friend Igala for hogging all the undivided attention of cute teen-hunk Ucal at Hall. Minki had chased after him for years, since their grandfathers were friendly neighbors on the farm within Society City Four, the southern part of the region. She wasn't really hurt inside the ancient Cadillac car when Igala barely rammed into the illegally parked hover car on the Hall campus.

However, the real teen driver of the hover was guilty and now dead from the show of Zulu Time, last night.

Ucal figured that out also, since he was both smart and good looking. Thus, the birth of the future children of Ucal and Minki together would be gorgeous and smart.

She giggled with a smirk into the microphone first, bouncing a fake injured arm into the air. "See my broken limb? I was badly injured when my friend Igala crashed her car, without warning. I was inside the front seat, slapping my face and my arm into the ancient hard windshield. The windshield didn't get hurt but I did. I demand just and justice for my injuries."

Too bad, the live audience couldn't communicate through a speaker system, since the Zulu Time room would be roaring with loud booing noises.

Henoana spun around with a gasp and a whisper to see Igala, without lifting and talking into the hand held microphone. "Why did you not tell us about the numerous limb injures on your friend Minki? We could have offered to fix your organs and limbs with our coin. Now, you have doomed us to..."

I gasped in shock, jabbing a finger with a sour frown and a matching tone at Minki across the room into the face of my mom. "She doesn't have a boyfriend. And she's faking it good, Mom. She was not hurt. I barely hit..."

"Quiet." Oltole reached out and slapped the collar bone of Igala with a worried brow and a whisper. "We must respond back in our defense before the ending of the twenty seconds of time."

I gasped with worry. "O yeah, I forgot." I leaned over and ripped the microphone from the glove of my mom, moving to stand beside Henoana. I lifted the microphone to my lips, turning with a smile and a nod to see Jackie and Jaime on the back wall, "Tag. I call Tag. The Tag, I call it. Tag..."

Henoana leaned over with a sour frown and a whisper into the cheekbone of Igala. "What are you doing, Igala? You are getting us into deeper trouble."

"Nothing is more a deeper trouble than Zulu Time." Oltole whispered with a sad frown.

"Where is Ucal?" Genic turned and scanned the open archway with a smile.

Jackie lifted both arms in the air with a stern face and serious tone, facing Igala, without twirling around in a circle to see each glass screen. "Stop, now. Silence, now."

Jamie lifted both arms with a stern face and a serious tone, facing Igala too, without twirling around in a circle to see each glass screen. "The Tag has been called by one of the Zulu Time team members."

Minki frowned into the microphone and stared at Igala. "What's happening? What did she say? Repeat it, Igala? I didn't hear it. O. It's some fancy ploy, but it won't work here in Zulu Time..."

Oltole whispered for her eardrums only, holding onto the hands of Segue and Laddie. "I'm going to die, tonight." Laddie was crying with Segue as they hid their faces into the skirt of their grandmother.

Jackie jabbed a finger with a stern face and a nod to Igala. "Who is your Tag?"

I dropped my mouth in silence, without an answer. Ucal told me to say the word, Tag. He didn't explain the reason. I couldn't fathom a reason or an answer either.

" _Me."_ Ucal ran from the open side door of the criminal hallway with a smile, waving both hands, twirling in a circle like the twin hostesses for his fun and swung around with a grin, slamming into the nose profile of Igala with a chuckle and a smile. "Sorry, I'm excited, gorgeous." He wore a matching aquamarine colored tuxedo like Genic and Segue with a black bowtie and a matching pair of hand gloves. His cheekbones were covered in a set of red and purple dolphin animal designs, squeaking a cute musical tone as he smiled with a laugh into her face.

"What?" I turned and whispered into his smile, feeling worried and scared, hearing the musical tone of the star facial designs on my cheekbones.

Minki spoke into the microphone with a growl and a sour frown on her re-designer foundation, jabbing a fake re-designer fingernail at Ucal as her tire facial design flexed and roared into her eardrums. "What's this? What's going on here? Why's he there? He's not part of her family."

"What is this?" Henoana turned and frowned at the rear strawberry blonde hairy skull of Ucal. "Why is he here? What's happening here inside Zulu Time? What is Tag? Why did you call out the word, Tag, Igala?"

Genic reached over and patted the collar bone of Ucal with a smile and a nod, standing behind Ucal and Igala. "I told you that Ucal would come and save the day."

"I don't know." Oltole stared at the rear skull of Ucal with a sour frown.

Jackie raised both arms into the air with a stern face and a serious tone. "Stop, now. Silence, now."

Jaime pointed at Igala with a stern face and a nod. "The Tag call is actually a person substitution mechanism within the Zulu Time rules. The family unit can substitute another person to fight for them inside the Zulu Time, except one original team member has to stay with all the Tag mates."

Jackie smiled at Igala. "Who is the original team member staying behind with your Tag mate, Cee team of criminals?"

"The Tag..." Jaime twirled around in a tight circle within the pretty dress with a smile to see each glass screen.

"The Tag..." Jackie swirled in the opposite direction in a tight circle beside her sister within the pretty dress with a smile to see each glass screen also.

My eyelashes darted back to the set of swirling twins, then the wall of glass screens, and finally back to Ucal. He shrugged with a silly smirk in silence at Igala. My eyelashes turned and looked across the room at Minki. She had dropped open a mouth and pointing at the twin with a sneer, jabbing a finger at Igala in silence.

"Stay here?" Henoana turned and gasped into the face of Igala. "Who's staying here with Ucal? I thought that word meant that we were leaving Zulu Time, all of us."

Ucal squeezed the hand of Igala for support.

I squeezed his hand back with the secret silent signal, saying with a fake smile and a nod to my mom. "I'm staying with Ucal as the original team member of the Cee team of us." I turned with a smile of confusion and yelled to the twirling twin hostesses. "I am staying as my Tag mate."

Jackie stopped the twirl and tossed both arms in the air with a stern face and a yell. "Stop, now. Silence, now."

Minki frowned with a face of aquamarine tires, turning to see Jaime and Jackie with a sour frown and a sneer. "What? What does that mean? I mean, we vote. I mean, they vote for me and my boyfriend. I am the winner here today. I get my boyfriend and her..."

Jaime stopped the swirl and tossed both arms into the air as her ponytail wiggled with the colored sparkles in the air, dropping a chin down into her chest with a moan. "Zulu Time has ended."

The lights went black.

A set of Regulators entered through the criminal archway, reaching and dragging out the other family members of Igala from the room and back through the archway, herding them into a huddle, moving through the archway.

The lights illuminated on again.

Jackie smiled with a nod to see each glass screen. "The Tag has activated the Bowl rules."

"The Bowl?" Minki frowned. "A bowl of nuts and fruit slices. Yeah, the Cee team is nutty and slimy. What's going on here, Jackie and Jaime?"

"The Bowl..." Jackie twirled around in a tight circle within her pretty dress with a smile to see each glass screen.

"The Bowl..." Jaime swirled in the opposite direction in a tight circle beside her sister within the pretty dress with a smile to see each glass screen.

My eyelashes darted to the swirling twins again, then the wall of glass screens, and back to Ucal. He shrugged with a silly smirk in silence. My eyelashes looked at Minki.

Minki huddled with her family members and back stepped with a sour frown with a face of red colored tires, saying to Jaime and Jackie with a sneer. "I demand my just and my justice, now..."

"Stop, now. Silence, now." Jackie stopped the twirl and pointed at Minki with a growl.

Jaime stopped the swirl and pointed at Igala with a smile and a nod. "The Bowl has been called."

Jackie smiled. "The Bowl occurs when the justification case tally is an exact mathematical tie for both the parties, which does happen occasionally, and then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl."

Jaime smiled. "There is a second occurrence of the Bowl, when a member of either team calls out the word, Tag. Therefore, the justification case has been expanded into a cat fight between the new Cee team and the old Vee team, thus the fight will occur inside a selected Bowl environment until one team or one person lives without or with bloody injuries. Now, each team will leave the floor of Zulu Time and change into the appropriate gear and clothing for the cat fight inside the Bowl."

Jackie and Jaime waved a hand with a smile to see each glass screen, saying in unison. "See ya'll in a few..."

11:11 pm (late evening)

Limousine ride of the Smith home without Igala

Warm temperatures and night sky of light rain

The line of Regulators led and loaded the remaining members of the Smith family into an awaiting limousine within the light rain of the dark night, removing them from the Zulu Time grounds, which was the proper Zulu Time procedure.

The four doors of the limousine closed down and locked shut.

The limousine lifted up and tucked inside both skis from the hard pavement and sailed forward through the air within the light rain of the dark sky, soaring back to the home of the Smith family.

The tiny glass screen in each corner of the rear cabin showed the tan colored interior Zulu Time room with the new Cee team and the old Vee team.

Inside the Zulu Time room, Ucal hugged Igala, standing in place of the rest of the Smith family in front of the long tan colored sitting bench. Minki stood in the first spot behind her family with a sneer, finger pointing at Igala.

Then the lights went black.

Inside the limousine on top of the long bench of the adult compartment, Henoana cuddled with Genic, wearing the formal attire, streaming a set of tears with a sad pout and a whisper. "I didn't get to say good bye to her."

Genic reached over and patted her gloved hand with a smile and a nod, looking up to see each corner glass screen. "She'll be fine and dandy. Ucal is a big and strong boy. He'll fight and protect our daughter. I'm not worried."

Ucal spun around with a smile and dragged Igala toward the criminal door, running from the floor of Zulu Time and dashing down an empty hallway with rows of empty glass cages on top of a black carpet, moving toward the entrance doors.

The booths were empty, since the Smith family was the last justification case of the evening before Tag was called by Igala.

"Run! Run!" Ucal held her hand and ran over the black carpet through the open archway inside the Zulu Time hallway.

"Why?" I grabbed and jerked up the ankle-length dress over my kneecaps, exposing my blue jeans.

"We need to stretch our limbs for the fight inside the Bowl."

"I don't wanna..."

The criminal archway was open from the exodus of the Smith family.

Ucal jerked on the hand of Igala and moved them out of the Zulu Time waiting area over the wooden floor. He released her hand, lifting and tossing one kneecap at a time into the air, stretching out his leg muscles and tossed both arms up, down, and sideways into the air.

I ran slightly beside Ucal with a giggle and a grin of his funny exercises, understanding the task, kicking a leg into the air one at a time, since I wore a long dress and could fall, breaking an arm which would be very bad.

Ucal turned the wall corner, dashing ahead of Igala, warming up his limbs.

I turned the wall corner, slightly behind his wiggling buttocks with a giggle and a grin, since I was facing death, but I could still be entertained.

The twin golden tinted doors of the Cee suites approached within eye sight.

Ucal stopped and stood in place, kicking up both kneecaps to keep his muscles warmed.

I ran and slammed into his buttocks for fun, sliding sideways from his body with a grin and a giggle.

The entrance golden colored doors slid open.

He ran ahead with a stern face and a yell. "Get dressed. The Bowl starts in ten minutes, whether we are there or not."

"Why would it?" I halted and stood in the hallway, waving both arms with a puzzled brow at the back spine of Ucal, sliding over and retrieved my dirty socks and my pair of unpolished black and white cowgirl boots in one arm, standing upright with a confused brow.

"Get dressed." He advanced ahead to one of the adult rooms for a larger red colored T-shirt since he wore a pair of faded and ripped non-re-designer blue jeans underneath the sissy aquamarine oversized tuxedo trousers plus carrying a pair of his favorite cowboy boots in aquamarine and black colors. Each boot toe nicely fit inside an inner pocket of the oversized tuxedo jacket. He wasn't concern about the extra fashion clothing when he entered the forsaken Zulu Time. Tag had been called by Igala, since he was there to defend her pretty buttocks and replace her weak family unit inside the Bowl for the death fight. Then he would kill Minki with a laugh and a grin, not hearing her screams.

"How do...?" I exhaled with a puff of worry and turned, lifting the long gown up to my kneecaps, running into the first square shaped archway which was my selected room from last night.

Inside the my chamber room, I slammed open the door and stopped into the same black bedcovers and gasped, seeing a neatly folded, short-sleeved blood red colored tee shirt with a whisper and a worried brow, without upsetting the she-ghosts inside the room. "The Cee team wears blood red to cover any bleeding injuries. The Vee team dresses in silvery baby blue." I exhaled with a puff of fright, not moving, holding my breath, closing my eyelashes. "Don't cry. Don't panic. Because Ucal is here to help, thank goodness." I gasped for breath with a stern face and a serious tone. "I win, Minki." I tossed off the fancy evening gown, the matching gloves, and the pair of sandals into the air as each item hit the floor, slipping off my personal com-d, since Ucal had told me to choose water as the battle environment within the Bowl.

My com-d would probably drown down underneath the water.

I tossed it onto the bed with a set of other important worries and sat down over the cold marble floor, slipping on the pair of dirty socks with an individual unpolished boots and stood upright, stomping the roaches on the floor. Just kidding! I stomped both feet into a comfortable position inside each boot heel and reached over, grabbing and dressed in the new blood red colored shirt, pressing down both hands over the soft and cool red colored fabric, feeling numb.

The knock sounded on the metal door with a loud ting.

I jumped with a tiny heart attack inside my worried heart, spinning around with a sour frown to see the closed door.

The bedroom door opened.

Ucal peeked around the cracked metal with a smile, shoving the heavy door open with his body, extending a hand to her. "Let's go, gorgeous. We got a fight to finish, now."

"Yeah," I reached down and grabbed the two backpacks, lifting and extended both of them to Ucal with a wink.

He parted his lips and stared at the two backpacks in the colors of green and blue. "What's this?"

"I take the liberty of bringing along a set of deadly weapons for our deadly fight within the Bowl." I smiled with a nod.

He accepted the two backpacks with a gasp and a smile with the extend hand. "Excellent!" He turned and extended the other hand with a wink in silence. I reached out and grabbed his hand with a smile and a nod, moving through the archway and cuddled into his new red colored T-shirt.

The bedroom door slowly closed.

He and I ran toward the closed golden tinted entrance doors and stopped, waiting on the click of the device.

The doors opened.

"Run, run..." Ucal released her body, running ahead through the archway of the Cee chamber room, shifting one of the heavy backpacks into the other hand. He lifted up and down each backpack like a workout with a huff of breathes.

I gasped at his fitness for a hunky cute teen and dashed after him with a confused brow.

The golden tinted entrance doors closed.

"Run! Run!" Ucal run ahead with a yell and a pant, moving down over the marble floor and turned to the right at the wall corner.

I ran beside him with baited breath. "Why are we running again? Where did you get the jeans and the boots?"

"We need to warm up our limbs for the fight inside the Bowl. I stored them inside the ugly oversized aquamarine tuxedo for my evil purposes," he ran over the smooth marble with a smile and a chuckle, not huffing from exhaustion, lifting up and down both heavy backpacks with his biceps.

"How do you know where to go?" I ran and gasped with alert. "You have done this before."

"Naw, gorgeous. This is my first time too." He ran with a chuckle.

I was too paralyzed with fear to slap his chest with the nasty remark, slightly running behind in a pair of heavy cowgirl boot next to his footsteps.

They slowed down into a walking pace toward a set of metal doors. The door opened by a team of Regulators. They followed behind the back spines of a line of coppery golden Regulators around the wall corner and continued down a wider marble floor.

"Where are we going? This is the hallway for the morgue. I can feel the coldness of the death in my bones." I wrapped both arms around my chest with a worried brow.

"Right. This is the only entrance into the Bowl from the Cee Building. The Vee team will use the other morgue side through the Vee Building."

"How do you know this? Where is the Bowl location? Where is Zulu Time location? The windows of the limo were blackened. However, I wasn't looking out the window anyways. Are we in the center of the city?"

"The Zulu Time rules, gorgeous. You and I live in the western part of the city. Zulu Time Building is located in the extreme northern part near the mountains and valleys. It's really pretty with green flat meadows of horses and tall peaks of white snow..."

"Snow?"

"The northern part of Society City Four blends a little bit into Society City One. There are four Society Cities..."

I sneered. "I know that." I exhaled. "Sorry, I'm nervousness and scared and frightened..."

"It's okay. Look, when we get into the Bowl area, you must fight for your life and mine." He chuckled and shifted and paired the two backpacks inside one hand.

"Okay." I exhaled.

"Look, this is..."

The line of Regulators turned away from Ucal and Igala, veering toward the rear wall, spinning around to face the steel doors as one unit. The end Regulator lifted and pointed a finger with a stern face toward the front wall.

Ucal and I stopped and turned to see a set of two steel gates of silver, moving ahead, stopping in front of parted seam. Ucal held the two backpacks with one hand and Igala with the other.

I exhaled with nervousness. "This is so dramatic on me and my nerves."

"I and my nerves, too," He squeezed her hand with nervousness too.

In front of the mysterious and hidden Bowl landscape, the solid door was colored dull silver like it had not been used for a long time. There wasn't a whistle or a bell. The door slowly parted and more slowly slid outwardly with a soft creak, revealing an open night sky with a bright full moon and tons of artificial lights around the tall man-made walls of beige tone. There were two flat and empty elevated platforms, facing each other that could hold about two hundred standing individuals with space for a few more shoes. The landscape even with the edge of the two platforms was a body of clear blue water that gently rippled across the entire surface of the Bowl arena.

I gasped with shock. "Water..."

He leaned over and gently cuddled her with a smile and a whisper. "You picked water as the environment. Excellent, I thought that you might have forgotten when we inside the ballroom dancing. You seemed upset."

I gasped. "Upset..."

He stepped forward, dragging Igala across the flat platform of painted blue concrete, holding the two backpacks in the other hand with a stern face. "Okay..."

Ucal and I stopped and stood at the edge of long flat platform as the calm blue colored water licked the long continuous edge from one wall to the other wall.

The area was square shaped with a body of water in the middle. On each side, there were the rows of thousands and thousands of tiny black colored glass screens that hid a world of cowards, who enjoyed blood and death.

I looked back over a collar bone, seeing the two doors. The two dull colored steel doors formed and completed a perfect box-like environment inside the Bowl arena. I exhaled with defeat. I couldn't climb up and over any of the four walls to escape from my nightmare. I turned and scanned all the tiny black colored glass screens on each side wall with a confused brow. "The area is ghostly silent. I hear the soft wind. I feel warm air. It just rained and stopped. I smell the fresh plants and flora flowers in the air. Where is the crowd of people? Why isn't there any noise, coming from the thousands of tiny six by six inches of glass screens?"

He exhaled. "The crowded sofas eat their delicious dinner supper meals on top of a lap tray and use the wall of glass to watch Zulu Time. Each wall of glass protects them from us. They communicate their pleasure with nothing. There is no tally of letters for C or V inside the Bowl. When they like the action, they cheer or chant inside the living room of their home. They wanna hear and see death, not experience it."

"I don't wanna experience death either."

He gently lowered the two backpacks down near his boot toes with a stern face. "So it's only us and them." He pointed toward the opposite elevated platform.

I turned and stared at the opposite platform with a sigh without pointing to the backpacks of weapons, giving away our secret with a stern face. "We need to break out the weapons and build..."

He leaned into her face with a whisper. "We can't do anything. We stand here and doing nothing until the twin hostesses announced the words, begin..."

"Okay." I turned with a gasp to see opposite set of steel doors part. Then the family unit of Minki appeared and moved over the surface of the elevated platform. "Minki has brothers." Minki stood at the end of a line of siblings. Her father was first in line beside her mother and two brothers.

"Minki is the baby smelly fish of the stinky family unit."

I exhaled. "Why do you hate her so?"

"Her grandfather sold my grandfather a group of stallions that were untamed and wild. When my grandfather tried to ride one of the wild beasts, it killed him." He stared at the platform and growled at Minki. "This is my time for revenge."

I turned and gasped into his nose profile. "You set me up inside Zulu Time for your revenge all this time."

He stared with a frown at the lineup of Minki's family. "No. You caused any accident with your ancient car. Then I kindly paid for it and got you outta of it. Then I suspect but I don't know. But I suspect that little smelly fish got the teen driver to report you to the Regulator. That's how your family was invited into Zulu Time. You only become invited to Zulu Time when there is an actually crime. However, there wasn't any actually crime, since I paid the teen driver. Then the teen accepted it from my personal coin account. So the accident was closed and buried..."

I gasped. "The family died in Zulu Time the other night."

"Yeah, the teen driver and his family tried to go around a non-criminal offense with a criminal defensive move." He turned and smiled at Igala. "Thank you. You tattled to the Regulator about me paying the repair cost..."

I gasped. "Did you get into trouble?"

"Not for helping a cute girl, gorgeous."

I laughed for a brief moment of happiness. "Thanks for the cute girly comment. But you call every girl, gorgeous, so you should find a new sweet endearment for..."

"I am Jackie. Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice." The voice of Jackie Jones without a face on the numerous ting glass screens echoed inside the Bowl.

"I am Jaime. Welcome to the Bowl, the place of peace and purpose." The voice of Jaime Jones without a face on the numerous tiny glass screens echoed into the Bowl."

"Brood of vipers! You are condemned to Zulu Time" The Zulu Time speaker blasted into the air wave inside the Bowl arena and over each wall of glass. Then the bell sounded with a deep baritone dong.

I turned and growled at Minki, who was a non-injured passenger in my car accident. "That b..."

"...boat is our transport to the other side for the fight of death. We don't want them to trap us here on our side when there is a fake ocean of water for maneuvering and flight." Ucal shoved her toward the water. "Take off your boots. The heavy footwear will weigh your body down and waste your energy and then get into the boat."

I halted and stared down with a worried brow at the wobbling tiny row boat of white wood. "I feel sick."

He leaned over with a stern face into her cheekbone. "You're only scared. I'm only scared too. We're here. Fight your fear. Conquer the Bowl."

I turned and faked a smile. "I..."

"...too," He hugged and released her with a stern face, moving toward the first row boat and squatted down on both kneecaps over the edge of the platform. He lowered the two backpacks over the concrete and reached inside with a stern face and a serious tone. "We split up the weapons." He lifted up and removed both socks and boots, wiggling his naked feet in the air with a giggle and turned, invading the first backpack, pulling out the first weapon into the air with a sour frown, "A garden spade?"

I sat down on the rough concrete, removing one boot at a time with the sweaty sock, wiggling my naked toes over the cool platform and the warm breeze with a smile and a nod. "Yeah, the weapons are all garden tools. I have a sharp pair of tiny flower cutting scissors too. I hope this isn't a problem for you." I reached down and grabbed both of pairs of boots, standing and turned, dashing back to the steel doors and placed them in front to signal our anticipated happy return back to our personal possessions. I returned back and squatted beside Ucal.

He sneered. "The garden tools aren't the problem. The five skulls and ten hands are."

I looked up with a worried brow to see Minki and her family. "The Regulator said any weapon is legal."

"Yeah, we will have the same problem. A little boat, a big guy. And this will be a hand to hand combat with two or more fishes. Me and you ride inside one separate boat for the battle."

I stood up in place, crossing and uncrossing my arms with a sour frown. "No, we ride together..."

He reached and grabbed one of her wandering arms, pulling her back in a squat on top of the platform. "Naw, the boat's too small. We'll tip over and fall out. Do not fall out of this boat! Stay inside always. They got five boats. We got two. Don't worry. Look, I'll take down all five of them. You do nothing here."

I whispered with nervousness. "Okay."

Minki and her family members were loading into one boat for a sweeping victory.

Her dad stood upright and moved forward, wobbling side to side over the small floor, kneeling down in the front of the tiny row boat of white wood. Her mother stood upright and moved forward, wobbling side to side and finally kneeled down behind the back spine of her husband inside the same row boat. Then her blond haired older brother stood upright and moved forward without much wobbling and finally scooted behind the back spine of his mother.

The single row boat wobbled side to side, falling toward the Vee team platform.

The blond haired older brother of Minki, he reached out and grabbed onto the concrete with both hands, blooding his finger pads, pulling a body back over the rough platform with success. He stood upright with a sigh and squatted down, reaching down and pulled his mother out from the same boat too. They stood upright and cuddled in a tight huddle, pointing down to the single row boat with the father inside with a set of soft curses and a sour frown of frustration.

I smiled with an evil sneer, watching the family unit of Minki with understanding. One tiny row boat was for each body. That was the key, staying balanced and out of the cold water to fight and win.

Ucal continued to fiddle with both backpacks and each object with a stern face. "I'm splitting up all the weapons, equal number of weapons for each one of us." He pulled out the object and examined it, turning and pitching into one of the two boats. "You get the garden rack. I get the tiny pair of flower scissors. You get the garden shovel. Be sure and screw the two separate pieces together before you launch from the platform. I get the garden spade like a weird curved hand dagger or something."

I stared with worry at Minki and her family on the opposite side that was 1,000 feet from the Cee team platform. "We need to get going and start fighting right now."

He continued to distribute each garden tool as a weapon into the row boat with a laugh. "Minki and her family are still figuring out the boating arrangement. Let them use up all their stored energy and their smart brain cells, leaving the dumb brain cells. Then the fight will be ease and swift, I promise." He lifted the object into a confused brow. "What's this garden tool? I don't recognize it."

I turned and giggled at the garden tool, "The circular rotating blade of the lawn mower to cut the grass at my house."

He laughed for amusement. "Did you yank it from the bottom of the lawn mower? Do you cut the family yard too?"

"Naw. It's an extra one from the work shelf inside the family garage. My mom likes the yard short and manicured. The robot does all the work."

He gently caressed the blade with a smile and a nod. "And it is very sharp on each side of the horizontal design. Yeah, I'll take this one." He reached down and pulled out a newest object with a puzzled brow. "What's this?"

I laughed. "It's one of the rounded twirling blades beside the horizontal one on the bottom of the lawn mower."

"Okay. You get these two nicely rounded and serrated objects to fling at someone during your cat fight." He tossed each object down into the other row boat onto the floor as the boat wobbled side to side with wooden pain of impact.

I exhaled with more worry and nervousness to defend my life and his life inside the Bowl. "Okay. We need to leave."

He slapped both hands, removing the dry grass and dirt from handling all the garden tools, leaning into her face with a serious tone, "Here's your defensive strategy. Use the garden rack and lift it into the air but don't smack a face. If the ugly face of the Vee team member is too close, you'll get hurt. So, use it to push the other row boat of the Vee team away from you, keeping pushing the boat away, so that'll give me time to take out Minki's dad first. Then I'll start getting the rest of them."

I gasped. "What do I do?"

"I told you, nothing. This is my revenge. I'll get them all."

I whispered. "Okay." I turned and gasped at the tiny boat that wobbled side to side inside the huge sea of blue water within the fake Bowl arena. "Its...it's a very tiny boat."

He leaned over with a nod and a smile into her worried face. "Yeah, it's big enough. Get inside, now."

I scooted over to the edge of the platform with both naked feet in the air, slowly dropping down both feet down inside a smooth rough floor and scooted across, settling down into a single bench in the rear of the boat as the boat roughly wobbled side to side within the blue colored water. I turned and slapped the boat for the guiding paddle with a worried brow and a yell. "Where's the paddle to maneuver the row boat around the water? I can't find. I don't have one. The boat is defective..."

"Naw." Ucal sat on the edge of platform and slowly scooted down into his boat with a stern face. "There isn't one. That would be a weapon to use against and kill your opponent. Part of Bowl is bringing your own weapons for the death fight."

I exhaled with more worry. "Okay, yeah, I forget with worry of death." I reached down and lifted up the garden rack into the air near my face. I screwed the two separate parts together for my fight, making a long handled garden rack with a set of smoothly curved and downwardly pointing three prong blades. Then I screwed together the garden shovel for a second weapon to defend my person, placing the two long-handled garden tools down on the bottom of the tiny row boat in hiding and away from my naked feet from harm.

Ucal turned with a smile to see Igala as the stern of row boat wobbled side to side toward the Vee platform. "Look at me. Do what I do. Stand on your kneecaps down inside the floor of the boat and paddle with the non-dominate hand. Hide a weapon in the other hand, your fighting hand. We have to row around the water for both protection and attack with a hand. Go. Stay behind and near me. If you need help, I will stand and jump into your boat and rescue you, again, gorgeous." He kneeled down over the floor, dripping a left hand down into the blue colored water, hand paddling and turned the bow (front) of the boat around, sailing forward toward the boat with Minki's dad. Ucal reached down and hid the pair of tiny garden flower scissors inside a right fighting hand. The father of Minki would be the strongest of the family unit to eliminate first in battle.

I leaned over to the side lip of the row boat, paddling with both hands, moving the boat slightly behind Ucal for my protection. The garden rack rested down in the floor for my fighting with one of the Vee row boats.

Minki jumped down from the Vee team platform and landed inside the floor of the tiny row boat as it wobbled side to side but did not tip over. She slowly stood upright and balanced with a set of extended arms, moving ahead over the floor and stopped, leaning both arms and a torso over the bow (front) of the row boat, hand paddling directly toward Igala with a sneer. She had two sharp steak knives for the final kill, if she could get close enough to stab one of the eyeballs of Igala, creating suffering death.

Ucal hand paddled toward the platform of the Vee team with a sneer at good speed as a young and healthy male teen with a set of broad shoulders and a set of rippled biceps.

The row boat of Minki's dad turned to face Ucal and launched ahead from the Vee platform too. He leaned over the bow with a nose bridge almost touching the water surface, swiftly paddling with both hands to meet Ucal for the first death inside the Bowl. Then he would assist Minki in killing Igala with ease. His boat sailed fast and crooked, ramming into the side of Ucal over the water surface. He jerked back with a sour frown and a sneer from the bow impact into Ucal's boat, leaning forward a head and a torso over both lip of two row boats, reaching out and grabbed the left arm of Ucal, trying to pull the teen out the boat and down into the water.

Ucal was too big and too strong to be yanked out from his boat, pulling a body in the opposite direction, slightly dragging Minki's father closer to his sneer of death instead.

Minki's father slid the center point of his body over a set of two wiggling lips of two row boats.

Ucal reared back the right fighting arm and swung around a hand, jamming the sharp tip of the tiny garden flower scissors into the dad's eyeball, left.

Minki's dad swiftly released Ucal with a scream, grabbing and covered a bloody eyeball with both hands as the two row boats broke away and drifted apart over the calm water. He dropped down and fell into the water, emerging up into water surface with a scream, swimming with one hand and bobbed up and down over the calm ocean, holding the bloody eyeball of blindness and pain.

A dull silvery tinted triangular shaped fin emerged up from the water surface, sailing directly toward the wiggling upright body of Minki's dad.

The blonde haired older brother of Mink sat back on both kneecaps inside his row boat and pointed down with a gasp and a yell. "Shark..."

Minki stopped her hand paddling and turned around with a gasp to see the shark and her father in the same spot inside the water.

The mouth of the shark opened and grabbed the head of Minki's father, closing the jaws, diving back down underneath the water with its meal. Both the wiggling legs and the two naked feet of Minki's father raised and kicked into the air over the rippling water and then disappeared below the clear blue sea.

"Meet my new little friend! I think he likes you, dude." Ucal laughed down at the ripping water spot where the father of Minki used to swim with an evil tone.

I covered my parted lips with both hands in shock, seeing a real shark inside the Bowl area.

The blond haired older brother of Minki, he leaned over the stern of his boat, hand paddling straight toward Ucal with a sneer, since the shark was busy eating the meal of his father. The boat sailed with force and hit into the middle of Ucal's boat.

Ucal wobbled side to side, leaning sideways, catching his balance upright and turned with a sneer to see the blond haired older brother of Mink.

The older brother of Minki, he sat back on both kneecaps inside his row boat and raised a steak knife in one hand, releasing and sailed it through the air molecules, missing Ucal.

Ucal wobbled side to side, punching a fist into the air, getting nicked by the tip of the sharp steak knife over both naked arms. The steak knife dropped down and fell into the water.

Minki sat back with a gasp and kneeled inside her boat, reaching over and grabbed, rearing back an arm and tossed a heavy butcher knife at Igala.

One of my eyeballs watched the fight fist-to-knife of Ucal and the older brother of Minki. The other eyeball watched Minki and her sneer as I ducked down toward the side of the boat, feeling the tip of the ugly knife, hitting and cut into my upper naked arm flesh inside the red shirt. It was a tiny wound, bleeding red blood over my arm and the white wood of the boat. I sat back on both kneecaps, sneering in pain and angry.

The other blonde haired younger brother of Minki sat inside his tiny row boat and leaned over, hand paddling over the side of the boat toward Ucal with a sneer and a shout. "Get him. Kill him. Get him..."

I turned with a gasp and a worried brow to see Ucal. He was hand-to-hand fighting with the older brother of Minki. The rock hit my arm, coming from the good toss of Minki on the side of my boat. I leaned down with a sneer and found the weapon, standing upright over the floor, balancing my body and the heavy piece of steel in a right fighting hand. I swung my body to the left for the distance and spun forward, releasing one of the rounded lawn mower serrated blade into the air. The blade twirled sideways in the air and hit the rib cage of younger brother of Minki with lousy deadly aim from Igala.

The younger brother yelled in pain and grabbed the bloody wound with both hands, standing upright, wobbling side to side inside his boat and tripped over the side lip, dropping down and fell into the water also.

The same dull silver tinted fin emerged up from the water surface for a second time, rippling a set of tiny waves toward the bobbing object of another meal. The mouth of fangs and a head of black eyes rose up from the blue water, chomping down on the head of Minki's younger brother, swiftly diving back down both bodies into the blue sea.

Minki turned and screamed at the sight of her younger brother again, covering a face, streaming a set of tears.

I sat back down over the floor and covered my mouth with a gasp and a stream of tears. "I killed. I murdered a person. I only wanted to wound him with the small sharp blade. Ucal was going to kill them. I do nothing here." I sobbed with my tears of horror and murder. I was a good person. I didn't mean to harm the brother, just turn the boat from Ucal.

Minki continued to stare with a sad face down at the bubbling water where her younger brother used to be and turned with a sneer to see Igala with a shout and a growl. "You're dead, Igala."

Ucal turned with a worried brow and yelled to Igala. "Use the garden rake. Hold her back from your boat. I'm coming, Igala." He leaned down over the stern (rear) of the boat, hand paddling toward Igala, since the shark was enjoying a second member of Minki's family unit.

I wiped off my tears, turning and leaned down, grabbing the garden rack, flipping it up and down over the lip of the side, resting it on top of the lid and watched Minki.

Minki crawled forward and leaned over the bow (front) of the row boat, swiftly hand paddling her boat toward Igala with a sneer and a soft curse.

I lifted the heavy garden rake into the air with a warning to Minki and then dropped it down over the lip of boat to aid my weak biceps and my two soft hands, carefully watching Minki with a worried brow and a worried heart.

Minki sailed closer, wobbling the row boat side to side as she sat back and moved around each side of the boat, dripping a hand down into the water, maneuvering her boat closer to Igala. She yelled with a sneer. "I am not going to waste my knives. I'll wait until I can see your pretty aqua colored eyeballs and then I will stab it with my pretty knife." The side of her boat hit the curved three prongs of the extended garden rack of Igala, ricocheting backward as the boat wobbled side to side over the water.

I gasped with the violent impact strength of the boat and the rack, gritting my teeth, shoving the rack back into her row boat as my row boat sailed backward into the tight corner space between the platform and the wall of rows of tiny black glass screens of viewers.

Minki rapidly moved forward and switched side to side on the boat, hand paddling closer to Igala with a sneer.

The blonde haired older brother of Minki leaned over the side of the boat, hand paddling into the water, tossing one at a time a rock then a knife then a rock and then a knife at Ucal.

Ucal danced side to side on both kneecaps on the floor, ducking and landing a face down into the deep floor of his row boat as each weapon hit the concrete wall with a ping between the platform and the wall of tiny glass screens. Or the weapon hit the side of the boat with a thud. Or the weapon hit the boots and blue jeans of Ucal with a soft thump as Ucal grunted with angry and fear. But he continued to hand paddle over the stern (rear) of the wobbling row boat toward Igala for the rescue.

I shoved the garden rack with my biceps, a set of gritted teeth, and a set of aching biceps into the side of Minki's boat, sending her boat backward over the water. The water rippled in cute waves.

Minki continued to sail forward and hand paddled toward Igala with a sneer for the deadly kill with her knives.

The mother of Minki leaned over the side of her boat down into the water, hand paddling with a sneer, lifting and tossed one at a time a large rock at Igala, missing each time.

I slowly shifted and moved the heavy long handled garden rack with the curved downwardly pointy prongs to the side, watching the mother of Minki and then felt the violent impact strength of her boat into my boat. I shoved my rack backward with a set of gritted teeth, biting my tongue as the blood splattered over my lip with a growl.

Ucal almost rested down over the floor, reaching and grabbing the hand-held garden flower shovel with a curved and pointy tip and sat back on both kneecaps with a silly grin, turning away from Minki's older brother and flung the tip of the shovel sideways, releasing his gripe. The shovel tip twirled end over end, sailing through the air and aimed at the collar bone of Minki's older brother.

The brother wobbled side to side with a sneer on both kneecaps, missing the shovel tip, losing his balance and fell over the lip of the boat and down into the water.

The same dull silver-tinted fin emerged up from the rippling waves for a third time and sailed directly toward another wiggling body inside the water. Her older brother screamed and swam backward toward his boat in fear. The shark continued to swiftly chase, diving down and opened its mouth underwater and grabbed a naked foot. Her brother turned and grabbed the lip of the boat with both hands, jerking a body up and into the air as the shark chomped down on the foot then the kneecap, and finally the leg. Her brother screamed in fear, slowly dropping down into the water with the shark.

Ucal turned and leaned over the stern (rear) of the boat, hand paddling with both arms like a swimming stroke, trying to reach Igala. Igala was blocked inside the two wall corners between the platform and the wall of glass screens as the two sailing boats of Minki and the mother of Minki converged on Igala.

The mother of Minki sat back on both kneecaps on top of the bench, rearing back and tossed a pear knife at Igala. The knife hit the side of the boat with a thud, falling down into the blue water.

"Drown her. Drown the boat. Let the shark get her." Minki continued to hand paddle over each side of the row boat, jabbing a finger at Igala with a sneer without moving passed the long-handled garden rack and the arm strength of Igala.

I inhaled a big huff of air and leaned forward, gritting my teeth and shoved the three prongs of garden rack into the side of Minki's boat, losing my gripe. My garden rack hit the lip and tilted upright, sliding down into the water. I leaned over the lip to see red colored water which flood in heavy red blood of the three dead bodies that the shark ate for a midnight snack.

Minki swiftly sailed backward with force from the rack with a scream, falling face down onto the floor, bleeding a nose.

I turned with a sneer to see an empty boat then gasped.

The mother of Minki leaped into the air and dropped down into the water, seeing the shark. It was still eating her second son. She emerged up and over the water surface, mouth spitting and cursing, swimming toward the boat of Igala with great arm speed rather than hand paddling the tiny row boat.

Ucal hand paddled with a worried brow, seeing Igala and the mother of Minki. "Grab the long-handled garden shovel. Hit her! Hit her over the head with the garden shovel. Kill her before she gets to you, Igala."

I turned with a gasp and a shaky pair of hands, reaching down for the garden shovel and slowly lifted it into the air. I held the shovel in the air above the lip of the boat, clearly seeing the bobbing shoulders and head of Minki's mother in the water and near my boat. I whispered with my sobs and my tears. "I can't. I can't kill her. I'm a good person. I didn't murder people."

The mother of Minki swam toward Igala's boat, spitting water with a sneer and slapped a hand on the wood of boat, reaching up and cupping a hand over the side of Igala's row boat.

Ucal yelled inside his boat. "Hit her with garden shovel! I'm coming but I can't reach you in time."

"Get her. Kill her, mother!" Minki leaned over the bow with a sneer, swiftly hand paddling towards Igala and her mother as fast as she could after her body had been shoved away by the garden rack and the surprising strength of Igala.

I held the shovel between two shaky arms with a set of tears and sobs with a shout. "I can't do it. The shark will get her in the water for me."

Ucal leaned over the stern (rear) of the boat, hand paddling with both arms, looking back over a collar bone to see the older brother of Minki. The shark held the dead body, shaking it side to side with fun, pumping a stream of human blood proteins down into the blue water. The water looked more maroon colored than light blue. He turned with a worried brow see Igala. "It can't. It's busy, eating its other meal."

"I can't kill, again." I whispered with my tears, my sobs, and my fears. "I can't do it..."

Ucal hand paddled and yelled with a set of heavy breathes. "Look at me. Close your eyes. Look at me..."

"Ucal..." I turned with a whisper and a worried brow to see a blurry figure of tallness, a head of shoulder length strawberry blonde hear, and a face of red whiskers that glowed through the bright artificial light. Ucal was hand paddling inside his boat toward Igala.

"Close your eyes." He yelled and hand paddled toward her boat.

The mother of Minki cupped the other hand over the side of the lip, kicking both legs and feet to climb over the lip of the row boat and finally kill the young teen.

I closed my eyelashes, facing the sound of his baritone smooth voice, hearing his loud words.

Ucal yelled. "Now, there is a watermelon in front of you. In front of your shovel, there is a big green and ripe watermelon. We're having a happy picnic today, Igala. Bust the watermelon open for our lunch. Hit it. Hit the watermelon now. It will feel kinda soft and hard at the same time when you hit a watermelon. Hit it, Igala!"

"No. No. Mother, move! Get outta the way of the shovel and Igala." Minki shouted with worry and stopped her hand paddling, sitting back on both kneecaps with a gasp, waving both arms with a worried brow.

I held my breath, thinking of a green ripe watermelon that I had eaten last summer. My shovel was going to bust the watermelon for another picnic with Ucal. I smiled with happiness, thinking of Ucal and our picnic today.

The mother of Minki lifted and leaned a head and a torso over the lip of the boat as the top of her hair roots wobbled side to side directly underneath the garden shovel.

"Lift the shove in the air. Whack the watermelon hard, now, Igala." Ucal continued to hand paddle with a worried heart and a loud yell to Igala.

I smiled and lifted the garden shovel with a smile and a grunt, slamming down the smooth bottom of the steel into the watermelon, feeling both hard and soft materials. Then the shovel slipped and tilted over the lip of the boat, felling from my hands and down into the water.

"No." Minki grabbed the sides of her face with a scream and a stream of tears. "Mother..."

I heard a scream, opening my eyelashes, seeing the lip of my boat, without the wobbling head and shoulders of Minki's mother with a gasp and turned to see the other Vee row boat.

Minki cried with tears and growled with pain, reaching down and grabbed two handfuls of knifes and large rocks. She swiftly stood upright on top of both kneecaps, rearing back with both hands, pitching all the hard objects at Igala.

I heard the rock hit the side of the boat, gasping in total shock that Minki still wanted to kill me. One of the knives hit the side of the boat with a thump, flipping up and landing down on the sharp tip inside the floor of the row boat. I ducked side to side from the flying rocks, feeling scared again and reached down, grabbing nothing with my hand. I reached up and touched my face, feeling heated and hot.

Ucal stood inside the floor of the boat, holding a folded pruning knife in a right fighting hand with a sneer. "Minki, look at me!"

Minki turned with a smile on both kneecaps to see Ucal and slowly stood upright on her naked feet, wobbling side to side over the floor, moved backward with a grin and a shout, standing on top of the bench and raised both arms, wiggling her fingers. "Look at me, Ucal." He reared back an arm and pitched the hand-held pruning knife tip at her face, missing. Minki lowered down and extended both arms to form a heart shape over her chest with a smile and a laugh to Ucal. "You cannot kill me. And I cannot kill you, either. So we can be friends and more. I love you. I call a truce to all the bloody fighting here inside the Bowl. I win. And then I will let Igala live, if you marry me today." She extended both arms out to him and then moved them parallel down to the water surface with a smile and a nod. "Tell me how you feel now!"

"I hate you." He shifted and twisted a torso to side, swiftly twirling around to the face Minki, releasing the horizontal lawn mower blade from the dominate hand. The blade twirled sideways and gleamed in a set of black twinkles from the moonlight, sailing smoothly through the air and hit, slicing off the smile and the rest of her ugly head from the throat of Minki.

The head of Minki flipped up into the air with a rolling twirl, hit its peak, descending down and dove directly down into the ocean of maroon colors. The standing of body of Minki tilted sideways, dropping down even with the lip of the boat side and then the body dived neck first into the waters too.

Ucal climbed back down into the floor of the boat, leaning over the stern and hand paddled to Igala. "I'm coming, Igala. Stay put!"

"Ucal," I sat back with a whisper and a puzzle brow to see a blurry figure of tallness, a head of shoulder length strawberry-blonde colored hair and a face of red whiskers that glowed through the moonlight of the dark sky and stood upright inside the row boat. I swayed to the left and to the right and then to the left, feeling dizzy, closing my eyelashes from the sea-sickness of the sea waves. I had never been on a boat ride before. The boat was rough with a bouncy motion. Ucal jumped over and landed onto the floor of her boat. My hand reached out for the hand of Ucal as I stumbled and fell backward down over the hard wooden floor of the row boat, seeing the blue twinkle in the star and the blue iris of his eyeball.

And then blackness invaded my mind.
283rd day of the current year

12:01 am (early morning)

Cold temperatures with bright stars and moonlight

Zulu Time Medical Ward

Bedside setting with Igala and Ucal

I blinked my eyelashes open to see a silver colored smooth ceiling, shaking a body and groaned in pain inside the metal hospital bed, "Ugh..."

"Hey, gorgeous," Ucal held and patted her hand, looking down with a smile to Igala inside the metal medical bed.

"Where..."

"Don't talk. You're inside the medical ward. You're okay. You don't have any broken bones. But the rear of your skull hit the bench of boat like a bouncing ball, then I rescued you, thou."

I whispered with a crock. "My parents?"

Ucal smiled. "They're at home. That's part of the Bowl requirement. No one is left inside the Zulu Time campus but all the live and dead players of the Bowl and the Regulators, of course. You parents are home safe and sound and alive like us. We won. The Cee team won. Minki and her family can't swim with a friendly shark. They all drowned and were eaten. The shark had fun. I found it rather boring, of course."

"Ucal!" I lifted up and rested on both elbows with a gasp, wearing a hospital gown, instead of my wet clothes. "Where...where are my clothes? Do you undress me?"

He winked with a chuckle. "I did, indeed."

"I did." The medical robot turned away from the metal wall unit inside the medical ward with a drone of alto timber. "Young sir, it is your time to leave before I call a Regulator."

"Yes ma'am." Ucal stood with a smile and a nod to Igala.

"Wait." I tossed an arm with a confused brow.

Ucal kneeled down, leaning over her face with a grin, "Ah, my kiss, gorgeous?"

I frowned. "You told me to pick water. You knew that Minki and her family couldn't swim."

Ucal chuckled. "No. I know that Minki's family with five folks tight inside a tiny little row boat. However, they were smart and figured that one out. But fate prevailed, gorgeous. I didn't know about the shark, but the Bowl always carried a surprise guest too. So Minki and her family should've strategized more wisely. Even physics can't save five boats of fools," smiling. "If you can walk, then I can leave and take you home. Your family conquered Zulu Time. It's over and done here, Igala."

"Wait." I reached and pinched his naked arm.

"Ah, my kiss, gorgeous?" He leaned over with a hint of mint breath into her cheekbone.

"No, I felt sick and dizzy. I fall out the boat and into the water. Why didn't the shark eat me?"

"Physics, again, sharks only eat things in the water. You weren't in the water. You fell back into the floor of the boat when you got dizzy, because I had kissed your lips with a sleeping aid."

I yell. "Ya drugged me?"

Ucal tilted his chin with a wicked grin. "At the dance with my good luck kiss, it was really good luck too. Yeah, I saved you and your family. Your row boat had too much weigh with all five of ya'll. I even the odds, a lot."

"Wait." I winked.

He patted her hand with a hand, leaning over her face. "My kiss, gorgeous?"

I frowned. "My personal possessions, like my wet clothes, and dry boots and my com-d."

He lifted up and rattled a cloth bag with a wink and a grin. "In the bag, I think of everything, gorgeous.

I whispered for my eardrums only with a grin. "Except a special endearment for me..."

He frowned. "What did you say, gorgeous? I couldn't hear your mumbling."

"Thank you, Ucal." I smiled.

"Ah, my kiss, now, gorgeous?" He leaned down with a set of puckered lips for the sweet reward from the sweet girl.

"No kissing or hugging allowed inside the medical ward on a patient. Please leave, young sir, now." The medical robot lifted up and floated, hovering behind the back spine of Ucal with a set of flashing pink, green, and red lights over the metal frame.

Ucal stood upright and turned with a frown to see the medical robot, tossing both arms. "Okay, all right. We...I'm going. Get dressed, Igala. Then come out and meet me outside the room." He moved toward the open archway of the medical ward space.

I laughed with a smile, shifting around the bed linens, going back home to sleep inside my warm bed.

07:07 am (early morning)

Warm temperatures with bright sunshine

Home of Smith family with breakfast

Her family sat around the dining room table like usual, slowly eating with a set of pings from the utensils and the tings of glass tumblers.

I stared down at the plate of food, picking at the eggs in silence, feeling better. The rear of my head had barely tapped the edge of the boat seat when Ucal reached and grabbed my arm but couldn't prevent my downfall, so to speak.

Last night, I had a slight headache without blood inside the medical ward, inside the limousine ride, and inside my bed mattress during sleep.

This morning, I felt alert, healthy, and sad, looking down with a stern face to see my com-d.

The com-d was silent.

Since, five years of age, my girl pal Minki had always pinged on my com-d in the morning during breakfast to annoy my mom. But she couldn't do it now, since she was dead. I killed her. Wrong. Ucal removed her head from her neck inside the Bowl of Zulu Time to save the family of Igala.

Henoana stirred the food with a sour frown and stared down at the black colored hair roots of Igala. "You do not have to go to Hall, Igala. You can stay home and rest with your granny for the day. Then, you can go next week to Hall and work on your set of re-gen tests."

Genic chewed and swallowed the food with a smile, staring down at the black colored hair roots of Igala. "I disagree, dear. Igala is a strong young almost woman, who turns eighteen in another several months. She survived all of it. And it is done, now. You should go back to Hall like it is a regular day of your life, where you are preparing for your future, Igala." He didn't want to use the word Zulu Time, so Genic substituted the word for that nasty noun of just and justice of death and dying bodies.

Oltole chewed and swallowed the food with a nod and a grin of food particles between her teeth. "Ucal will be there. I can assure you that promise. His parents would not allow him to miss a day of Hall like...like a bum. It is part of life. But we are here and we are all part of your life, Igala. Go back to Hall, today, sweetheart." She looked down to the plate, scooping up more food.

Segue chewed and swallowed the food in silence, after exposing a body, a mind, and a set of emotions to Zulu Time. He didn't want to see Zulu Time on the wall of glass or tattle to anyone about it. He continued to eat, thinking about the missed homework assignments from last night, completing all of them this morning.

Laddie stirred a set of fingers into her food plate with a grin and a giggle, instead of eating the breakfast meal, not understanding it and the new day. Her parents were too busy worrying about Igala to notice the child's fun and messy activity.

I wanted my life to return back towards normal, eating meals with my family, studying for a re-generator test, and seeing my new friends at the Hall. I dropped the fork and looked up with a smile and a nod. "Yeah, I want to go to Hall, too. Ucal is there and..." I exhaled. "My other friends too..."

Genic nodded with a smile, wiping his mouth and stood upright from the chair. "Come on, Igala. I'll drive you for the rest of week as your personal chauffeur to Hall. Next week, you drive yourself."

08:08 am (early morning)

Hall Building location

Warm temperatures and partly cloudy with sunshine

Parking lot setting

Genic rolled ahead and then parked the ancient car near the bottom steps of the Hall Building, without killing the engine for his work.

All the other teens stood around the parking lot and on top of the front porch, stopped the talk and the walk, turning around to see the aquamarine colored ancient Cadillac that belonged to their classmate Igala.

Dfee and Ucal stood in the middle of the front steps, shoving into each other body parts with a grin and a chuckle as they both watched and waited for Igala. They ran down and slammed into the metal frame of the ancient car with a smile and a chuckle. Then both of them reached for the single smooth door knob of the passenger door together.

Dfee had the advantage over his friend with a set of non-sore muscles from a fight inside the Bowl, firmly shoving Ucal to the side, pulling the car door open and extended down a hand and a wink to Igala.

I reached and grabbed his hand, standing with a wobble of nervousness, sadness, and fright. I had not ever met another person that had survived Zulu Time. There were thousands of people, since Zulu Time was held every evening on each and every wall of glass inside every home within Society City Four.

Dfee pulled her into his rib cage with a whisper and a smile. "How ya feeling, this morn, Igala? I saw the lousy fighting skills of your Tag parent on the glass at my house, last night. Good thing, the shark was hungry," chuckling.

Ucal turned and slammed the door with a nod and smile at Genic. "See ya around, Genic..."

Yeah, Ucal. Bye, Igala." Genic moved ahead and rolled the car ahead for his work day, a regular day of life within the Smith family.

Dfee swung around with a smile and cuddled Igala, climbing up the steps. "Now, if you had picked me as your Tag mate, then we could be a..."

Ethdamn dashed and slammed into the bicep of Ucal with a sneer and a whisper. "Criminal..." He ran up the stairs and away from Ucal and turned, stopping and standing inside the open archway with a set of curled lips and a soft sneer to see row of three teens, spun around and moved into the darkness of hallway.

Twaddle motioned with a hand and shouted a set of his usual instructions as always. "Come in, teens. Go down the hallway to the Wall of Memories. Get inside, teens..."

Dfee looked up with a sneer to see the disappearing back spine of Ethdamn. "What did he say?"

"Good morning." Ucal gently touched the arm of Igala with a smile and a laugh.

Dfee exhaled. "Really, Ucal? That was good morning. It sounded like..."

"Good morning, Mr. Twaddle." Ucal turned and smiled at the nose profile of Twaddle.

Twaddle shouted with a cough to see Igala. "Go down the hallway to the Wall of..."

"...memories." Ucal nodded with a smile to Twaddle, finishing the sentence for the stunned re-generator teacher. He wasn't surprised with the tart reaction of seeing both Ucal and Igala on the next day of Hall. There were a set of thousands of survivor from Zulu Time, the next morning. And there were thousands of losers of Zulu Time. Society City Four contains thousands and thousands of people. And there were several Halls for hundreds of teens to study for a re-generator test.

Dfee leaned over with a sneer and a nasty sour tone into the nose bridge of the teacher. "Hi there, Mr. Twaddle, the waddle..." He moved ahead through the archway, holding the hand of Igala and turned with a smile and a chuckle to see the nose profile of Igala. "So what are you going to paint on the wattle and daub of Minki, Igala?"

Twaddle exhaled and folded both hands into a set of fist with a whisper and a sour frown. "One day..."

I gasped with sadness, forgetting about the morning ritual at the Wall of Memories. Maybe, I should have missed Hall, today.

Ucal squeezed her hand for comfort and leaned over with a sour frown to see the smile of Dfee. "Shut up, Dwit! The point of painting the wattle and daub is for all the ones that leave the planet, each night."

Dfee nodded with a smile. "O yeah! Well, if it was me, since I'm Dwit, Dfun, Dfitt, and Dfee and I can take care of my handsome selfie and your cute self, Igala. I want you to remember that..."

"Shut up, Dwit, Dfun, Dfitt, and Ddumb! Be silence for once, boy." Ucal hung onto her arm as they moved through the wide archway.

I wiggled side to side and jerked both arms up into the air from the hot bodies of two male teens, moving ahead and stopped, standing in front of a lonely tale with a whisper and a sad pout. "No. I need a table for myself."

Dfee moved and stood beside Igala with a worried brow. "Naw, you need some company, today. You can sit with me. Ucal and his bad breath can seat together and alone at a single table, today."

I smirked at the silly pun, since the breath of Ucal was minty fresh from last night. "I need a table just me for today."

Ucal shoved a body into Dfee with a stern face and a serious tone, shuffling both of them across the pavement to a new table for the morning wattle and daub work. "We understand. Let's go, Dwit."

Dfee swung around with an open mouth and a worried brow, walking backward, jabbing a finger at the back spine of Igala. "But..."

Ucal pulled Dfee to the new table, sitting and seeing Twaddle. "She needs time. Let her mourn. The smelly fish was her friend..."

Dfee swung around and slid into the chair with a smile. "Not my friend, but I'm glad you eliminated the stinky odor in our shared classroom. I can breathe the fresh air now. But I wonder if there are more smelly odors that need elimination in here." He turned with a soft growl to see the sneer of Ethdamn as the teen sneered at Dfee.

"I, too..." Ucal turned and scanned each table of paired teens with a stern face and a serious tone too.

Twaddle moved ahead and sat down at the corner table with a sour frown and a soft whisper, staring at the black colored hair roots of Igala. "You know what to do. Please get started, teens."

I looked down with a smile to see the com-d, reading the two sweet texts from my mom and my dad, telling me to have a good day at Hall and looked up with a smile then a stern face.

Twaddle was staring at Igala.

I slid out from the chair and stood upright with a smile to see the concrete wall with an array of tall and short wet painted wattle and daub formats, thinking about my decision.

The other teens slid out from a chair and stared at the back spine of Igala for a split second, turning away from her with a stern face to face the tub of jumpsuits or the tub of colors or the tray of cutters.

Ethdamn slid out from the chair with a soft sneer, turning and paced toward the concrete wall of color and swung around with a set of curled lips behind the back spine of Igala with a soft growl. "Criminal..."

I heard a mumbled faint voice, turning with a smile to see Twaddle then frowned. He continued to stare at Igala. I exhaled with a puff of nervousness and spun around with a stern face to see the tub of jumpsuits, moving ahead and stopped, collecting one and side stepped, advancing to tub of cutters, selecting a dull pointed drawing pen.

Keer swung around from the tub of colors and Igala with a set of curls lips and a soft sneer. "Criminal..." He moved ahead and dashed toward Wall of Memories, stopping and stood beside Ethdamn as they bumped two heads with a set of secret whispers and soft grunts.

I heard a mumbled faint voice, turning with a smile to see Twaddle and then frowned. He continued to stare at Igala. I exhaled with a puff of nerves and swung around to see the Wall of Memories, advancing ahead and stopped, standing in front of a red colored wet paint with a smile and my cutters for the morning's work.

Lexedo pulled up beside the back spine of Igala with a grin and a giggle. "How are you going to survive Zulu Time, tonight, Igala?"

"What?" I spun around with a gasp and a worried brow to see the nose profile of Lexedo.

She stared with a smile and a chuckle at the wet painted wall. "A joke, learn to laugh again, Igala. Why did you pick a red wattle and daub?"

I turned with a sigh to stare at the wall too. "She wanted a pair of naked legs with a set of wiggling toenails that were painted in the color of bright lavender on top of the soles of a pair of black colored sandals, since lavender was her favorite color."

She nodded with a stern face. "O. You're drawing a memory of her. Nice!" Lexedo spun around and moved to the shared table with her girl pal Kallidin with a grin and a giggle. "See you later, Igala."

I turned with a stern face to see the back spine of Lexedo, "Yeah, later." I swung a stern face to see the wet paint, dressing in the jumpsuit and exhaled with a sigh, reaching to the top of the block and draw a straight line with the pen.

03:03 pm (mid-afternoon)

Hot temperatures and bright sunshine

Home of the Smith family with Igala

Living room setting

Genic came at two pm and collected Igala from the two teen males, who stood guard over his daughter at the bottom of the stairs at the Hall Building. She entered the car with the assistance of the two young male again.

Genic rolled the car forward down the hard pavement with a laugh and a smile, talking with Igala on the way home. He had left his work office early in the morning, since the work atmosphere was not kind. Some of his co-workers were not happy with the final results of the Zulu Time events, last night.

He stopped and parked the ancient car inside the garage from the heat, sliding out and escorting his daughter into the house. They entered and moved to the long sofa, sitting with smiles and chuckles, enjoying the regular day, after a terrible yesterday.

Henoana was home also, since her work environment was not cheery but moody also, regarding the ugly activities inside the Bowl, last night. She came home early to breathe and relax, helping the teacher robot with the domestic house chores, since the hands-on physical work relieved her stress and tensions of a bad day.

Tomorrow would be much better.

People would see a new vile episode of Zulu Time, tonight, coming back into work, talking about all the events like usual.

Inside the living room, in front of the low table, near the wall of glass of funny cartoons, the com-d pinged on his wrist. Segue reached down and shut off the devise with a sour frown, looking down at his homework assignments. He had been receiving numerous texts from his friends, thinking that he was a hero on Zulu Time, last night. However, all day long on the wall of glass, the nosy media reporters had been labeling the Smith family a set of heroes and asking for the hero family to ping the news station's com-d for a personal live talking interview.

The wall of glass wiggled and changed from the cartoon show that Laddie was watching into the tan colored room of the Zulu Time. Jackie and Jaime Jones stood together over the floor and appeared on the new program, wearing a set of matching aquamarine colored ankle-length evening gowns with a face of white painted star designs. The hair was done and painted in colored sideways lines. They smiled with a nod, saying in unison. "A Tag team won Zulu Time, last night."

Jackie smiled with a nod into the wall of glass. "There has not been a Tag team to win Zulu Time in almost sixteen years. Zulu Time has been attempting to contact the winning Tag team members for a live personal interview, without revealing the family names and the family address."

Jaime smiled with a nod into the wall of glass. "We are not allowed to know the proper names of the family unit or any other details about the family unit. But Zulu Time feels that this is a rare exception for all of our curious viewers..."

Genic turned and sneered at the wall of glass. "Turn off that glass. There has been too much excitement this week within the Smith family." Segue stood and moved to the glass wall, punching a finger into the glass, clicking off the illumination and swung around back to the low table, working on his homework assignments.

Oltole turned and frowned at the black wall of glass. "The Regulator Society is always intrigued and interested in a young recruit that can handle a tense moment."

Segue drew on the paper with a sour frown. "It's a robot."

"It is not a robot. It is a human dressed up like a robot. It does possess one or two emotions behind that pair of silver-tinted shades." Oltole smiled then exhaled. "Your Grandfather Smith was a Regulator."

Genic turned and frowned at Oltole, "Mother?"

Oltole nodded with a smile. "Then he up and quit and then married me. We had a child to rise. He loved his new career but loved me more. But the Regulator Society is intrigued and interested in young folks joining the Regulator program. A Regulator is schooled in numerous situations. You have demonstrated a set of hidden talents in out maneuvering your opponents, twice, Igala. The society likes it when a Regulator regularly out thinks a criminal."

I turned and stared at the black wall of glass without comment. I didn't want to be or see a Regulator again. Even though, I had teased Minki about a job as a Regulator yesterday in Hall. However, Minki was only interested and intrigued with cute teen-hunk Ucal as my teenly hormones could relate in interest and intrigue with Ucal too.

Oltole patted on the hand of Laddie with a smile. "At the age of eighteen, you can become one of them. That is your decision only."

Segue worked on the homework problem with a stern face and a serious tone. "Dad, why didn't you become a Regulator?"

Oltole said with a smile. "Your dad wasn't offered. When your Grandfather Smith quit the Regulator Society, your dad's application was withdrawn."

He whispered for his eardrums only. "It ain't cool to become a Regulator." Segue frowned down at the hard homework problem.

I turned and smiled to my granny. "You knew a Regulator? That seems a little impossible, Granny."

Oltole turned and smiled to Igala. "You know of a Regulator, too?"

"No." I frowned.

"He's a teen, now." Oltole nodded with a smile.

Genic nodded with a sour frown. "My childhood friend became a Regulator and then he married. Ucal is his son. Children of Regulators become a Regulator. Everyone has to work, hold a job, and make a living, so it is the most logical choice for some eighteen years old."

I gasped with a whisper for my eardrums only with caution and danger. "Ucal?" I wondered if Minki even knew that.

Segue kneeled down over the carpet, jolting down his homework answers with a stern face and a serious tone. "They're all robots."

Genic frowned. "No, son! It is a human, who has been slightly altered at the age of eighteen as a full time Regulator job."

Henoana turned with a smile and a nod, carrying a tray of cool beverages and fresh fruit slices for an afternoon snack before the dinner as the teacher robot worked inside the kitchen, preparing the meal. She stopped at the low table, leaning down and lowered the food tray over the surface and stood upright. She spun around and moved ahead, sitting down beside Igala on the long sofa with a smile and a nod, patting the naked arm of Igala. "It..."

A single knock echoed from the front entrance door into the living room.

No one stood upright and answered the door as all eyeballs darted toward the closed door.

A second knock echoed on the wooden door and into the room.

"Don't answer it, Mom." Segue stood upright from the floor with a whisper and moved toward his granny, cuddling into her warm body with a worried brow and a worried heart.

Laddie stood upright from the floor and scooted over the same sofa, cuddling with his granny too, watching the closed door with a puzzled brow of a five-year-old.

Henoana stood upright with a stern face and dashed toward the closed door, reaching for the knob.

The door opened.

She blocked the open archway with a body and a sneer. "We did our spell in Zulu Time. Why can't you just leave us alone?"

"You are not invited to Zulu Time." The short Regulator of coppery golden color with a pair of silver-tinted sunglasses stood on top of the front porch with a stern face and a monotone alto.

"Why are you here?" Henoana blocked the archway with a sneer, protecting her family.

The Regulator droned without a single emotion and a facial expression in glittery coppery gold and a pair of silver-tinted sunglasses. "You are not invited to Zulu Time. We would like to enter and discuss a very important matter with the Smith family this afternoon."

Oltole flipped a hand into the air with a smile. "Let them inside for the very last time, Henoana."

Genic stood upright with a stern face and crossed both arms. "No."

I held a stiff sitting body without moving with a stern face which hid my sobs and my tears of fear.

Henoana back stepped with a stern face, slamming both legs into soft fabric and sat down next to Igala, facing the two Regulators. One was short; the other was taller.

Two Regulators marched inside and stopped a few feet inside the living room without a smile. The short Regulator turned and stared at Igala, saying in a monotone alto timber. "Congratulations, Igala Smith. You have survived Zulu Time, twice."

I stared with a stern face at the short Regulator in silence fury.

Henoana frowned. "You are here for a discussion of what topic. Please just state your purpose and then leave our house forever."

The short Regulator nodded to Igala. "Society City Four would like Igala to promote the Zulu Time..."

"Promote death." Oltole sat on the long sofa with a sour frown and a nod, wrapping both arms around Laddie and Segue, cuddling them into her chest.

Henoana exhaled. "Zulu Time is nothing but a death game for a group of numb-minded individuals, without intelligent or morals or ethics or all three. Zulu Time should be outlawed. Innocent parties are being slaughtered with their entire families over something, because there is not any type of right or wrong ethics. It's just wrong for our present Society."

The short Regulator droned to Igala. "Crime is a part of Zulu Time. Zulu Time is a part of death. Therefore, death is a part of life. Igala is a shining example of innocence overcoming a true feat of vanity, if I can use that word. Igala would be able to share her innocent personal success story with other citizens within Society City Four." She turned to see Henoana. "These are the same citizens who share your same point of view, Mrs. Smith. Igala is a local heroine, saving her family twice. Every citizen wants to chat with her to hear the precious angel tale."

Genic sat on the soft and shook a skull. "No."

Oltole turned with a smile and a nod to see the nose profile of Igala. "Yes, I agree. The Regulator is sending a good message for the citizens. You are an example of innocence that had prevailed in this dangerous situation."

Henoana exhaled. "Igala wants to finish Hall, get a re-generator job, and start her new life. She is only seventeen years old. She needs to move on with her young life, pondering her long future."

The short Regulator turned and droned to Igala. "A scheduled Tour of Zulu Time has been arranged which would be similar to the Zulu Time Ball with dancing, dining, and socializing. The social hour will allow all the citizens to see and learn that fallacy of injustice within Zulu Time from one of the current survivors, twice fold. Your Tag mate and your Hall class mate Ucal has already accepted placement within the tour, since he also substituted for the rest of the Smith family during the Tag call."

I wiggled side to side with the nervousness. I liked Ucal. He did save the lives of her family and rescued Igala inside the Bowl, last night. And he was super friendly to Igala, this morning. But I wasn't interested in living my home for a dance and a plate of food, even with cute teen-hunk Ucal.

"That was his choice, not ours." Genic frowned. "Therefore, the answer is still no. Let Ucal go and tour the countryside like a good non-regulator. I promise that he will find a great distaste and non-love for Zulu Time, too. My daughter is too busy studying for a future re-gen job for her future within Society City Four."

Henoana stared at the short Regulator with a laugh. "Well, that's sound like some kind of fun. But Igala will be attending Hall each day with lots of homework projects to finish while determining which re-generator job she desires to pursue."

The short Regulator said. "Ucal is a Hall student with many homework projects to finish as well. He will be accessing them on his com-d, completing all the assignments on schedule while graduating from Hall. The Tour of Zulu Time is set to visit only the four cities of Society, since we had the distinct pleasure of viewing a young teen of Tag, saving the lives of the entire family unit."

Henoana looked down with a worried brow to see her manicured re-designer fingernails with a whisper for her eardrums only. "It is a rare feat, indeed."

Genic frowned. "Thanks, but no thank you. Igala is required to study and finish her homework projects on time. She would not be able to graduate Hall with that type of social schedule time."

The short Regulator said. "The Tour of Zulu Time is presented on a grand scale with an assortment of limousines, re-designer gowns, re-designer food, and a merry atmosphere of dinner and dancing. And Igala would not be required to attend a single Zulu Time event during the invitation period."

Henoana looked up with a smile to see the short Regulator. "Really?"

Genic whispered for his eardrums only. "I hate that word."

The short Regulator said. "The Tour of Zulu Time will pay all the coin for air transportation, re-built hotel rooms, re-generator food items, and re-designer clothing. It could also compensate with coin to Family Smith for their child's presence away from the household during the social invitation. And Igala Smith could keep all her used re-designer wardrobe items. Zulu Time would have no use for the soiled items."

I felt the soft fabric underneath my blue jeans, sitting on top of one of the re-designer long sofas that had come from the house of Minki.

As the solo winner of Zulu Time and part of the reward process, all the assets of the dead family members were given to the live family members immediately, without delay like the next day. All the used re-designer furniture with a set of Minki's germs had been delivered this morning to the Smith house by a set of Zulu Time robots. Every wall corner and every square inch of floor space throughout the Smith house suffocated from a set of open boxes of clothes, dishes, lamps, bed linens, and numerous other pretty assets that belonged to Minki, her parents, and her brothers.

Henoana turned with a grin and a giggle, scanning all the assets of Minki's family. "Re-designer gowns?" She leaned into Igala with a smile and a whisper. "Re-designer gowns, Igala. They're very expensive. Your sister is going to need all those re-designer gowns for her social events for now..."

I growled with a whisper into the face of my mom. "Now, Laddie is five years old. No one attends a social party at five years old with a re-designer dress, Mom."

She smirked with a whisper. "Well, things have changed for Laddie and us and you, too. I meant that you didn't get to attend all the popular social parties back then. Maybe, you could visit four or five cities socialize and then return home. You will complete Hall, graduate, and then get a re-gen job. Minki didn't have a single re-designer gown for your new and used re-designer clothing. However, Minki was short like Laddie, not tall like you. You can't wear her personal re-designer clothes, but Laddie can wear the clothing, when she is older."

I dropped and closed open a mouth, turning to see my five-year-old baby sister. Laddie wore a new set of re-designer play clothes, a pair of matching re-designer shoes, and a tiny facial design of a pink colored teddy bear on her cheekbone, left. I turned and continued to examine each family member, seeing a set of new re-designer clothes and a pair of matching re-designer shoes on Genic and Segue also. However, Oltole wore her same long old patched light blue cotton dress with a pair of worn and faded low heels and a sour frown at the two Regulators.

The short Regulator droned. "Any and all possessions for Igala Smith will be sent home here for free of coin and enjoyment."

Genic frowned at the Regulator. "I remember reading that the proper names of Vee team and Cee team are not ever revealed as a rule of Zulu Time."

I turned with a stern face to see my mom. Henoana wore a set of new re-designer clothes and a pair of new re-designer matching shoes as her face was shined in the new brown foundation of re-designer makeup that covered her natural pale tinted skin. And she had etched a tiny red colored butterfly design next to her eyeball, left.

I gasped with alert that all the assets of Minki's family also included a nice coin pot, where my parents had missed their work schedules today and went shopping with the family to the re-designer merchandise mall, without their eldest daughter also. I exhaled with a big puff of frustration, lifting and slamming both hands down into a lap like a good southern bell with a nod. I was a teen with a smart brain and a set of common sense of a big decision. My parents had received their reward from Zulu Time. And I had received a valuable lesson from Zulu Time too. Now, Zulu Time was done. I was finished with any type of Zulu Time business too. I desired to finish Hall and test for a re-generator job and eventually flirt and marry Ucal, my life's dream.

Henoana leaned over and frowned at her husband with a sneer. "They all saw Igala on the glass screens, last night. She is a heroine and a model for all young teens..."

"Yeah," Genic turned and laughed at his wife. "From the height of the black and cold outer space, Igala was a tiny dot of red on the glass screen or inside a com-d, Henoana."

The short Regulator said. "You are both correct. However, Igala Smith won Zulu Time. She is free from any claim of crime. And she has much to share with young and old citizens of today. Your granny lived during an ancient time with the human judges and juries. The drastic comparison would generate lots of intrigue and interest among both the young and old regarding the concept of Zulu Time."

Genic turned and faked a smile to the Regulator. "We all really appreciate the ancient history lesson. But Igala will finish Hall, and graduate, and..."

The short Regulator said. "Your Tag mate has agreed to the Tour of Zulu Time, Igala."

"Yeah, you said that twice, now. Good for Ucal, he's a good role model for violent and death." Genic nodded with a sour frown.

Henoana leaned over with a smile and a whisper to Igala. "I trust that boy. And you need to talk to someone your age about what happened inside Zulu Time and the Bowl. You can't keep all the terrible mess bottled up inside guts. Or you will implode. Ucal is going through the same mental stress, too. I think it would be good for you to leave home for a little while, honey."

The short Regulator said. "Re-gen jobs are plentiful, but the best re-gen jobs require exceptional skills in today's slow market. The Tour of Zulu Time would offer exposure of Igala Smith and her exceptional talents for all re-gen companies within the Society cities."

Henoana smiled into the cheekbone of Igala. "There, you go, Igala. We served and survived as a Cee team family unit. Zulu Time did not expose us for privacy concerns. But now, today, you should share your special talents with all the citizens, the young teens. I won't tell you what to do. But I would strongly suggest that the tour can benefit each younger kid today. The young teens only listen to icons, idols, and heroines."

The short Regulator listened and repeated for all eardrums the earned compliment. "Igala Smith, the heroine, what is your answer, please?"

I turned and frowned to Oltole as she shook her curls with a sour frown. I turned and frowned at Genic as he shook his skull with a sour frown too. Then I turned and frowned to the Regulator, studying the coppery golden hair and skin in silence for the last time of my short seventeen years old life.

"Yes, Igala is going on the Tour of the Zulu Time. When does the touring start, Regulator?" Henoana nodded with a smile to the Regulator, patting on the leg of Igala. "Her parents grant permission, since she is only seventeen years old and not an adult."

The short Regulator said next to the taller Regulator, who had not spoken one word. "Tomorrow morning, the Zulu Time air limousine will arrive and retrieve you from here to visit Society City One with your Tag mate and Hall classmate seventeen-year-old Ucal."

I wiggled side to side with nervousness for my future, without my parents and with a future Regulator Ucal.
284th day of the year

Society City Four

04:04 am (early morning)

Cool temperatures and bright starry dawn

Home property of Igala

Living room setting

I sat inside the used re-designer chair, feeling a series of painful aches, sounding with a set of soft grunts. The painful aches started at the top of the hair roots, going down to the naked toes inside the re-designer sandals. I wring both hands with impatience around the hair band. The hair band was extremely tiny, fitting around the meat of my pinky finger, right hand. I couldn't believe that this tiny hair band would fit around my thick rich black long waist length hair for a ponytail. I couldn't believe that I was sitting inside an abused re-designer dining room chair that came from my best friend, when I killed her in Zulu Time.

Zulu Time was a specific place and time for the criminal of a crime and the victim of the crime to meet all the same moment inside a very large tan colored room. The two opposite parties come together and debate the justification crime. Then, each citizen of Society City Four with a com-d or a communication device would serve up the true justice for each judged team. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice the individual justification case. There would not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member was allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty-second time period. Since each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time. Then, each viewing audience member becomes the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice.

I was the criminal of Zulu Time for slamming the front of the Old Girl into another object, a new hover car. The 'Old Girl' was an ancient Cadillac gasoline-propelled vehicle from an ancient year of 1970s which was last century. The Cadillac was a pretty aquamarine color that matched my eyeballs with a set of two horizontal doors and a convertible top which could be dropped down on any sunny day. The big car held eight wild smarthole teens or six mature adults or one responsible driver plus nine silly kids less than eight years old.

At the age of seventeen years old, the Society law granted a teen driver any type of transport with one, two, three, four, or no set of rubber tires.

A hover vehicle flew twenty feet up from the hard road pavement or over the smooth dirt soil, running on a combination of solar cells, electricity power, and every day garage from your kitchen trash can.

I had passed my cyberspace driving test on a transport robot at the Regulator office, anticipating both a birthday party and a car, since my parents bartered an ancient television for an ancient car.

The ancient Cadillac was not my first choice for a rolling or a hovering cool teen vehicle as my aquamarine irises eyeballed a new sports hover car, a gray sleek-looking semi-rounded mouse-shaped object, costing 50,000 coins.

Coin was money.

A cool hover car sucked up a set of two horizontal platform skis underneath the smooth flat belly of black metal while hovering in the air instead of using a set of four rubber black tires on the ground. The doors slid vertically up into the sky, hitting your nose bridge or bopping a chin on one of the older hover cars, instead of slanting out at a forty-five-degree angle on the ancient rolling car. A latest hover car was the new invention by a cool and smart re-generator, who re-designed hovering transports with both abused metals and new minerals on planet Earth.

The best girl pal of Igala, Minki claimed to be a victim as she rode inside the front passenger seat during the automobile accident.

However, I had not lost my justification crime within Zulu Time. I had called out the word, Tag. Then, my other schooler friend cute and hunky teen Ucal replaced my biological family unit of mother, father, brother, sister, and elderly grandmother as the new Cee team. Then, Ucal and I entered into the Bowl. The Bowl was a physical place of vicious cut throat fighting until one team member from the Cee team for criminal or the Vee team for victim stood, wobbling side to side in dripping blood proteins or tore guts, breathing.

Ucal had killed Minki inside the Bowl. Thus, the biological family unit of Smith inherited all the assets, such like, furniture, wardrobe clothing, vehicles, dishes, pot of money, and everything else inside the residential house of my dead and buried best friend.

I was a seventeen-year-old female and a non-studious academic student at Hall, preparing for my new life, selecting a re-generator job, getting married to some handsome and known teen male, and making a happy ending for my person inside Society City Four, yesterday.

Now today, I sat inside the abused and used re-designer dining room chair, wearing an ankle-length gown of bright yellow that could blind the sun. The dress necklace was a square shape design without a necklace, since a piece or a collection of gem stone jewelry was generally shunned on a teen, because only the wealthy adults could afford the luxury item.

Thus, I was neck-less, today.

The dress held a plaid front panel but there was a single column of girly bows, traveling down from the back of the neck and going down to the hem of the dress. I was actually not sitting on the column of bows either per my mom Henoana. My breasts were bouncing against the back rest of the dining room chair, feeling the tug and pull on a new ponytail by my mom. My pale tinted face was covered in pinky finger pad-sized poker dots of many colors, including red, green, blue, pink, orange, yellow, purple, black, and brown. Each color matched one of the girly bows on the rear of my back spine. However, my face didn't whistle or sing a pretty song, since I was supposed to talk about my almost death experience inside Zulu Time. My long black colored hair was painted in thin and long twirls of many colors, including red, green, blue, pink, orange, yellow, and purple that covered half of my hair roots.

Actually, I wanted to purge my personal almost death experience inside Zulu Time, if the scientists could do that.

Her mom Henoana stood behind the re-designer chair in the middle of the living room, wearing a new ankle-length re-designer black, red, and green color dress of vertical strips with a pair of matching new re-designer low heels, racking the hair brush through the black colored hair skull of her daughter Igala with a sour frown. "Do you even brush your hair at night before bedtime, Igala?" She possessed a face of slightly ugly wrinkles, looking beautiful within the new set of re-designer makeup at fifty plus years with a head of cropped black and gray colored hair that was painted in the pretty colors of mauve, peach, green, and yellow. Her normal skin tone was pale without the re-designed colored makeup. Today, it showed a beige foundation powder that was covered in silly red and black grasshoppers. Each word made the grasshopper whistle.

"Yes ma'am," I nervously wring the hair band between both hands over the back rest of the chair, waiting on the air vehicle limousine, compliments of Zulu Time. Her mom Henoana had accepted for her daughter yesterday afternoon to participate within the Tour of Zulu Time with seventeen-year-old schooler Ucal.

I liked Ucal. He was a cute and hunky male teen that made my girly hormones sung in soprano, but I was also very curious of Ucal, too. He was the son of a pair of Regulators.

A Regulator was a specific breed of police office within each Society City. Each one possessed a shiny coppery golden tinted body with a matching colored bald skull and a pair of silver-tinted sun glasses. The sunglasses were rectangular shaped, covering both eyebrows, both eyeballs, and both ears. The throat down to the ankles bone wore a coppery golden colored one-piece jumpsuit without a decoration of buttons, only a silver-tinted zipper and a golden colored pair of boots. A Regulator proclaimed sentencing of both judgment and punishment when the crime was committed within a family unit like a murder of a human baby or a murder of a pet animal. Both murders were automatic crimes of instantaneous death inside Zulu Time.

Her mom jerked the hair brush with force through the messy locks with a sigh and a sour frown. "You should brush your hair right after you brush your teeth, Igala. You have tons of twisted coils inside your hair. You want to look presentable as you visit all the different Society Cities, this morning. Now, I am ready. Please hand me the hair band."

"Yes ma'am," I whispered trying to be a good teen today and lifted a hand with the hair band.

Usually, each morning I sat with my family at the family breakfast table, eating the morning meal, hearing the familiar tings of the utensils on the top of the re-designer dishes before driving off to Hall.

Hall was a school.

I dropped the hand and then wring both hands together, nervously tapping on the bracelet communication device or com-d on the tiny screen without a smile to see my friend.

Com-d represented a mobile telephone.

Every morning and night, the Smith family unit sat together at the old model dining table each meal per their father's instructions. Since, the life of Igala was busy with school, boys, boys, and boys, while her dad's life was filled with job work, yard work, and keeping her away from the cute teen boys.

Her parents enjoyed the social gatherings before their two cute daughters and one mischievous son quickly grew up from a batch of silly kids into a set of careless teens.

I lifted up and tapped the bracelet communication device or com-d on the tiny screen with a sour frown, not seeing a text from another schooler friend, since my best friend was dead and lived inside the afterlife, if you believed in that stuff.

In the year 2078, all academic classes occurred within a home family environment under close parental supervision, starting at the age of four. Every household family was provided with a teacher robot from Society for academic lectures, ranging from literature to spelling to science. However, the teacher robot did not wash the supper dishes.

Some households owned an array of robots that performed housekeeping, babysitting, garden landscaping, and building repairs. The Smith family owned a teacher robot for the learning family students that acted as a housekeeping robot to assist her mom Henoana with the house work, since her granny Oltole was too old for any type of domestic chores.

When a student reached the age of seventeen years old, a training program was offered at the Hall, a place-like classroom for students. The same-age teens trained and tested their intellectual skills for a re-generator paying job within any Society City.

Henoana pulled back the black hair with the swirling colors on Igala into a tight ponytail, planting a striped color red, green, blue, pink, and yellow vivid bowtie around the tight hair strands with a smile and a nod, working both hands. Her facial grasshoppers whistled. "This is a pretty range of colors within your dark hair and with your new re-designer frock has dozens of tiny colors bows on the back of your dress. I love the color of this new re-designer dress. You made the best decision accepting the wonderful opportunity to visit the different Society Cities."

I said with a sour frown without a facial song. "Yes ma'am."

She narrowed her aqua colored eyeballs at the ponytail of Igala. "This is real life, Igala. You will see and understand how all the other people live within the other Society Cities. You are so lucky. No one gets to see or visit within a different Society City, ever. I don't know why. I guess it is too expensive. But you are young at the moment of present, so you will truly appreciate all the new adventures as an upcoming almost young adult."

"Yeah."

Her face of ugly grasshoppers whistled with a smile. "Here." The object flew over the hair roots of Igala and landed inside the thick dress, coming from the single hand of her mom Henoana. She giggled with a smile.

I gasped and stared down at the silver tinted object in the shape of a long oval, sitting inside of the dip of my breasts with a sour tone. "What the fudge is this thing?"

Her face whistled with a smile. "It is a collector bar. It will record and hold all your coin, after you have completed your speaking performance at each Society City. It is our payment with your absence from Hall. You will become further behind in all your academic classes because of the sightseeing fun tour. Then, when you return back home, you will re-enter Hall and finish your classes and graduation into a new re-gen job."

I stared down at the collector with a stern face, reaching out and touched the smooth metal. "Where do I hold a collector? I tote around a re-designer purse, Mama. But, the re-designer purse could be stolen with the object inside. If I remember correctly, any person can activate the collector bar, since it does response to a sweat hand."

Her face whistled with a grin. "Yes, you studied very well. It could be activated by you, if I desired it." She struggled with the hair of Igala with a smile. "Inside your fancy dress on the right side, there is a hidden small pouch like a tiny enclosed pocket which is made of water-resistant plastic, not fabric, for hiding such like objects. The man always escorts a lady on the left side of her body and her dress. Thus, you can access the tiny pouch at any time. During my days, a lady hid a pen knife during a date in case of..."

"Thanks! I understand." I reached out and touched the collector between my breasts with a stern face, feeling more painful aches over my hair roots from the non-loving touch of my mother.

Her fifty plus year old dad Genic was sleeping inside the slightly used re-designer bedroom furniture that came from the bedroom room of Minki's dead parents.

Her nine-year-old brother Segar was awake inside the bed mattress with a set of giggles and laughter, watching the new glass of wall that came from the bedroom of Minki's dead brother.

Her six-year-old sister Laddie was sleeping inside the slightly used re-designer bedroom furniture that came from the bedroom of dead Minki.

Her seventy plus year old grandmother was asleep at the unreal hour of four in the morning inside the ancient wooden bedroom furniture from eons ago.

Her mom frowned. "I have finished brushing and taming your messy hair."

I stood upright without turning around with a fake smile. "Thanks!"

Her mom reached down and straightening all the bows in the rear of the hair and on the rear of the dress with a whistle and a smile. "You look perfect, too."

"Thanks."

Her face whistled with a smile. "You should eat some breakfast. I don't ride much in limousines unless it is going to Zulu Time..."

"That's not funny, Mama." I stood upright with a sour frown to see the kitchen space.

Her face whistled with a smile at her daughter. "You know what I mean, Igala. Don't be a sour puss on the beautiful morning! But a limo flies very swiftly through the empty air waves. You need some food inside your stomach before you get air space during the ride and then you will ruin your fancy evening gown. I want you to take care of all the evening gowns, Igala."

I reached down and lifted the fabric over my hair on purpose, messing up the hair strands, locating the tiny plastic pouch and unzipped it. I checked the contents, showing a coin balance of zero and placed the collector bar inside the tiny pouch of dark plastic. I will get paid after completing each speaker presentation that earned a set of coins for my parents to use, to save, or to whatever. I zipped the pouch and dropped down the dress skirt with a smile, messing up my hair with a giggle, moving ahead into the kitchen toward the teacher-robot to place an order of greasy and sticky food entrees with a grin and a giggle.

At 6:06 am (early morning) with an awesome sunrise of yellow, red, and pink colors, the front entrance door sounded with a knock of a human fist as opposed to the musical door ding from the electronic door bell.

Henoana spun around with a gasp and a giggle from the dining room table and rushed toward the closed door. The door opened. She stood in front of the archway, lifting and shaded a pair of perfectly painted re-designer eye shadow and the associated pair of eyelashes from the bright morning sunrise with a smile and a nod. "Good morning, Ucal."

He was a tall teen male with a head of shoulder length strawberry blonde colored hair, a face of red dusted whiskers, a pair of blue eyeballs, and a tone of pale tinted skin, without any type of makeup facial decoration, and a pair of rippled muscles underneath a peach colored satin sports jacket, wearing a re-designer white T-shirt with a pair of ripped and faded re-designer blue jeans. And his favorite pair of cowboy boots of aquamarine and black polished colors. Ucal stood a few inches from the archway with a nod and a smile at the adult. "Morn, Mrs. Smith. I am here to collect Igala for our tour. Is she ready for our show? The limo is warmed also."

I wiggled side to side inside the seat, slowly standing upright from the dining room chair within an ankle-length evening gown of too much fabric, too many bows, and too much drama, slapping a pair of dirty and greasy hands of breakfast food over the fancy evening gown. Since I liked to disobey my mother and reached over, grabbing the re-designer clutch and the pair of matching yellow elbow length gloves with a semi-dirty hand with a giggle, slowly turning without a smile and moved toward the open archway with a fake smile.

Ucal was a gentleman, bumping and dashing around Henoana, rushing to assist Igala in the long dress. He reached out and touched her naked hand, cuddling and wrapping her naked arm around the sleeved arm of silly peach pastel color with a chuckle and a wink.

I exhaled with a puff of dread, smiling at his cuteness and his eagerness as a teenly hunk.

Ucal slowly twirled around and moved ahead toward the door with a smile, passing Henoana with a nod. "Good day, Mrs. Smith. Don't worry about Igala. She is in good hands with me also."

Henoana turned with a smile and followed the young beautiful teen couple, stopping inside the archway of the house, seeing the long limousine and cupped both hands with a smile near a heart. Her and her husband Genic worked as a set of re-generators.

Every working person was a re-generator, who re-shaped or re-designed something, such like, a car, a house, a boat, a building, a piece of dish, a piece of furniture, or a piece of clothing. Or a working parent was a re-merchant, who re-sold and re-designed products for coins. The raw resources of oil, minerals, plants, and animals were plentifully abundant on planet Earth. However, Society had established a new rule that all natural sources were to be re-shaped, re-designed, and re-structured until destroyed, hence the ancient Cadillac.

She whispered. "Yes, Igala will marry Ucal and live happily ever after. Their children will be so beautiful and strong. Yes, Zulu Time was the best thing to happen to us and our daughter Igala."

Ucal and I strolled over the flat pavement of the driveway. One of the golden colored Regulators, the driver of the vehicle stood beside the open rear door without a smile or an emotion, only twinkling of gold within the sunrise of the new morning.

I stooped down low without hitting the rooftop with a forehead and slid over the smooth leather seat with a set of deep emotions of confusion, fright, fear, anticipation, excitement, dread, angry, and other feelings, sitting near the opposite window of the long bench seat, slapping the yellow colored re-designer purse and the pair of matching gloves beside the door handle.

Ucal stooped down a skull and a collar bone with a smile, sliding over and safely stopped one foot from Igala with respect. He could see that she was worried and afraid of the tour, the future, and them as a couple. He didn't feel that way.

The door closed. The driver moved ahead and slipped down inside the front seat, preparing for the department from the home of Igala.

Ucal turned and smiled at her nose profile. Inside the Bowl, Igala had handled herself with strength and bravery. These were two elements that made up a great Regulator. His parents were a married pair of Regulators and very good at their paid jobs, too. Ucal would follow in their golden footsteps, too.

The limousine slowly lifted from up the pavement, tucking inside the pair of landing skis and then slowly sailed through the air, traveling over the ancient roadway to the first destination on the Tour of Zulu Time.

Limousine ride of Igala and Ucal

Westerly direction

Interior rear bench setting

I could feel the rumble of the engines underneath the sandals without burning off my naked toes and as, my stomach swayed side to side with the air bumps within the sky. I was happy to have a full stomach for the air flight ride.

I wring both hands with nervousness and stared ahead through the clean windshield with a heavy heart and an active mind. I didn't know what to expect from the social and profitable event, the Tour of Zulu Time. I thought that the show of Zulu Time was terrible, where justice was served for both the victim and the criminal. However, I found that the criminal could be an innocent person like my person.

I had received an ancient car with a set of four rolling wheels for my birthday to travel back and forth from Hall, my school of learning something for a re-designer job within Society Four, my home town, if you please.

Then I had some fun with three of my girlfriends and accidentally slammed into a parked car, an expensive solar flying car.

In past history, the damaged car would have been repaired with monies, coming from the family or another resource.

Now, the damaged car was ignored and not fixed. Then the family unit as the victim went in person and whined with a sissy voice to a Regulator about an injustice of a piece of solid metal. Then, both the two family units appeared within Zulu Time, a few hours or days later.

I turned and smiled at Ucal. "What do you wear a jacket of silly pastel colors that is really meant for a little girl?"

He reached down and touched the jacket sleeve with a smile and a chuckle, staring at Igala. "The pastel color is calming, one. The pastel color is non-threatening, two. I obey my mama, three."

I giggled with a nod. "I obey my mama too. So where are we going first? How long is the trip? What do we do, second? We are traveling in the direction of west and away from the sunshine."

"Our home, Society City Four is kinda in the middle of everything. So, we will venture to one city in a different direction."

"I don't really know about the other Society Cities. Where are they located?"

"This week, we will travel to the west, to the south, to the east, and then to the north. We are traveling to Society City Three. It is all short hills and fertile yellow colored farmland, out of our region, but within the limits."

I frowned, "The limits of what?"

He smiled. "Just the limits of Society, there are numerous cities of Society that will invade our nostrils and our eyeballs. We will visit each one."

I exhaled. "And do what within the limits of Society City Three?"

"We will talk about our personal too close to death experience and too great vivid triumph inside the Bowl arena."

I exhaled. "I really don't wanna talk about my personal almost death experience to anyone."

He smiled. "That's okay. I do. I wanna. I will explain the option of the Bowl rather than an instant death inside the Zulu Time tan colored room."

I exhaled. "I thought all the citizens knew that."

"Did you know, Igala?"

I turned and frowned out the window with a soft tone. "No."

"The rules of Zulu Time and the regulations of the Bowl are located on the com-d site for any pair of eyeballs but..."

I turned and smiled at him. "Why have I never heard of Society City Three?"

"You don't hear it. You eat it." He laughed."

"What?" I laughed.

"All the fresh foods and the juicy meats come from these lands that are grown by a set of farmers."

"O." I nodded with a smile. "O yeah, Dfee talks and eats at the same time, too."

"Yeah, Dfee talks all the time. I hope that he doesn't annoy you during Hall. I can punch out his face. Then he will never annoy you, again."

"Yeah, Dfee talks all the time. I don't want you to punch his face. Punch his rib cage, first. Then he'll squeak like a girl."

He laughed with a nod. "Yeah, I can do that."

"I was feeling nervous about this tour thing with Zulu Time. But I feel better now that I'm with you. Why are we doing this touring thing to all the different Society cities?"

"Like you and your family experienced, Zulu Time has become a profit making show, not a justice of honor program. Too many family units are coming into Zulu Time. And too many family units are dying from too many silly causes. No one seems to read much less understand all the rules of Zulu Time."

I frowned. "Minki did."

He laughed. "Minke didn't. She might have read the rules that applied to her greed. But, she missed the Bowl rule. Therefore, we will educate the populous about Zulu Time, hopefully saving some innocent lives like you and me."

"O," I nodded with a smile. "That is a nice thing to do for the other innocent lives of innocent people like me and you. Will anyone listen?"

He gasped with a fake smile and slapped a chest. "Of course, we are the first Tag couple to finish and win a Bowl, a great big honor."

"Honorable mention," I turned with a whisper and a gasp to see the window, pressing both greasy finger pads over the clean glass, wiping the residue off both hands. "Wow, we're flying really fast over the landscape and inside the clouds. I can't make out a single object like a tree or a roadway. It is all white clouds or a big long blend into reds, greens, browns, pinks, oranges, and other colors of one single piece of landmass."

He turned and smiled at his side window. "We travel at one hundred miles per hour to the western side of Society City Four. If we drove a regular hover car, then it would take about six hours or more. This method, we arrive within six minutes or so. We will arrive in time for breakfast. During the breakfast meal, I will talk about Zulu Time and the Tag concept. I estimate that it will take up the entire morning and the full afternoon. We are not scheduled to speak during suppertime. So we can eat together inside my suite..."

I turned with a gasp, "Your suite?"

He winked with a smile. "We can eat in your suite."

I gasped, "My suite?"

He smiled. "Look, we can figure that out before suppertime. Then we can take a tour of the city limits and see some of the highlights of Society City Three."

"Yeah," I nodded with a grin. "We can take a tour of the city and eat at one of the many restaurants for fun. What kind of food is offered?"

"All the food stuffs come from Society City Three onto each plate of a citizen within Society City Four. So, we can indulge with our fingers and out taste buddies with some new dishes of delight. I'm getting hungry thinking about us as we tour the town, you and me. Me and you, kinda, like a date."

"Yeah, I guess." I nodded with a smile.

"I predict that we'll both be too tired from the rush of new faces and new questions. I suspect the night will end without a bang of fireworks. We are on a mission, not a vacation." He chuckled with a nod.

I exhaled with a puff of frustration. "I understand the mission."

The limousine reduced speed, slowed, and halted into a stop within the air molecules in front of a pair of steel gates among the warm temperatures with bright sunshine.

"Why did we stop? Are we inside Society City Three? What does it look like?" I turned and gasped at the side glass window. "O no! There's a single Regulator out there. Why is there a single Regulator out there? Where are we located at? I can't figure out the location with Society City Three."

He turned and smiled at the front glass windshield of the vehicle. "There are actually a row of Regulators in front of an object. We are actually at the outer perimeter or outskirts of Society City Four. No one comes out this far without being detected and monitored and then arrested by a Regulator. Turn and look through the front windshield."

I turned and gasped at the front windshield. "It is a see-through wall of steel rods. What is a wall of steel rods doing in the middle of the landscape? How did it get there? Why is it there?"

"It is a steel gate with a set of numerous hollow holes where the beams are crisscrossed within the gate pattern. You can see through the naked beam pattern with a pair of naked eyeballs. However, your person or a vehicle cannot drive through the steel gates of beams until you have permission from the Regulators."

I stared at the steel wall, "Why not? Why so? Why is a gate here?"

"There is a fifty feet wide and fifty feet high two-dimensional steel gate on this side of Society City Four that leads into each Society City. The reason, no person is allowed to leave from Society City Four and wander into another Society City. You have not. I have not. The other reason, the residents of the Society Cities do not invite strangers into their fair lands. So, no one is allowed to enter there, either. The Regulators are posted here and the other steel gates to enforce that rule which is known to each adult."

I gasped. "We are strangers."

"We are invited to visit each Society City."

"By whom?"

"The Regulators arranged the Tour of Zulu Time program."

I exhaled. "Okay, I guess. I just wanna be greeted, not gutted by a sharp pointy small weapon."

"We want. I promise. And I will defend your honor and your fancy dress, gorgeous." He winked with a laugh.

The window of the driver dropped down. The Regulator stepped forward and leaned down, listening in silence to the driver of the air ship limousine and then nodded with a set of secret words back to the driver. The window rolled back up. The Regulator stepped back and nodded with a golden tinted skull to one of the Regulators.

The center Regulator held a palm sized device and pressed a button. Then, the entire row of Regulators parted, separated, and split into two groups, sliding sideways and away from the center of the steel gate.

The steel gates parted with a set of squealing noise.

I turned and leaned into the side window with a gasp to see the Regulator and the part of the long steel gates. "I hear a squealing noise. What is that?"

"The steel gates are kinda rusty from non-use." Ucal smiled.

The steel gate slowed parted and separated into two solid sections, opening the two separate gates in the outward direction and safely away from the row of Regulators and the grill of the limousine.

I dropped open a mouth and stared at the silence mechanics of the gigantic steel gate and as, my mind could not compute the needed mathematical requirements for that giant structure and the electronic operation.

The two separate gates slowed and then halted in the air waves and above the air waves.

The limousine slowed flew forward through the air waves.

Dead Man's Land setting

I turned and gasped at the landscape through the side window. "Wait! The land is about to end. Ah! There is not any more land."

"We are inside a flying airship, Igala. We are fine. We lifted and flew from your house to here. Flying a hover vehicle is the common and safest form of transportation over your ancient car." He chuckled at the white clouds.

I pointed at the glass and the white clouds with a sour frown and a matching tone. "I know that. I mean, there is not more land. We are not flying over a plot of land. Geez, we are flying over empty air space which no air ship normally does. Why is that? Is Society City Three stationary in the skyline? No, it can't be. It is a farmland city."

He turned and smiled at his side window, pressing both hands and a nose bridge into the glass for adventure, too. "O, that! You probably don't know this new information, since it is only taught when you are employed with your new re-gen job. Society City Four is shaped like an oval island and surrounded by a very deep canyon. The canyon goes around and around Society City Four at each geographical direction."

"I didn't know that." I pressed both hands to the glass, feeling the cool air from the white clouds. The window slightly was bombarded with water droplets from the clouds, too. I gasped and smiled. "Look, look down there. The white clouds have parted. I can't believe it. I can't believe what I am seeing. There is land down there. It is way, way down there."

"We are crossing over Dead Man's Land."

"Are there really dead males down there, coming from where?"

"I don't know. I have never been down there inside Dead Man's Land. There could be..."

"I see trees, forests, crops. I see rows of crops like...like food or something. And I see a house. Yes, I see a house. It looks kinda funny..."

"The houses are made from dried mud."

I spun around with a puzzled brow to see the strawberry blonde colored rear skull of Ucal. "Wait! How do you know that?"

He stared out the window with a stern face to see the landscape, too. "From my parents, Dead Man's Land is the canyon that surrounds all of Society City Four. But, it holds live males and females, too."

I swung back around with a smile and pressed both clean hands to the glass. "Why is that? What is down there?"

"A city of people, they call their homeland, Dead Man's Land. No one goes down there. They don't like any visitors, either. A long time ago, some people from Society City Four visited and didn't come back. Then, the people send up a note inside a basket with a balloon. The basket held the cut-off hand of one of the dead visitors. So, no one talks or goes or knows about the canyon around Society City Four. Thus, no one else has died."

I gasped. "That's awful! We are only trying to be friendly and such."

"The people of Dead Man's Land are not friendly and such."

"If I narrow my eyelashes, I can see scattered houses and rows and rows of crops. So, the people of Dead Man's Land farm the land for food. Do we provide them with any type of food stuffs or clothing stuff or cars or anything re-designer?"

"No, they exist down there all alone and isolated from any of the other Society Cities. The only way down is inside a hover car. But, the Regulator will not allow you to do that."

"Hmm, I see why. We are very high into the clouds. I only see tiny objects, not big objects." I spun around with a giggle and slid across the bench seating, slamming into the elbow of Ucal. "What do you see over here the same thing or something different?" I pressed both hands and a nose bridge into his side glass window with a smile. The landscape showed more scattered houses of red colored and more rows of crops.

Ucal leaned over and hugged the waistline of Igala with a chuckle and a smile. He liked her curiosity and enthusiasm of life. She was a fun and pretty girl to be with. And he dreamed of her marrying him after graduating from Hall within a few months. His mom and his dad approved of Igala, too. Then, he and Igala would become a pair of Regulators defending the laws and the people of Society City Four.

I gasped with a smile. "Look down there! There are more little houses of red colored. It looks like a tiny village or something. I can't see any people. I wanna see a person. Do they look like us?"

"I guess so."

"Will we visit the people of Dead Man's Land?"

"Not without a shotgun," He laughed.

"Ucal?" I frowned at the window, not seeing him.

"I mean it. I am not going down there without a shotgun in one hand and a knife in the other." He chuckled.

The grill of limousine slowly emerged over the land of rows of white flowers, short white tall trees, and plot of yellow dirt. The view of the Dead Man's Land slowly disappeared from the side windows of the vehicle.

Society City Three

Yellow dirt. Yellow hills. White flowers

Warm temperatures with dull sunshine and white clouds

I smiled with a giggle. "Look over there! It is yellow dirt and yellow colored hills. Awe! The flowers are so pretty in white tones. Everything is yellow and white colored. Is this Society City Three?"

"Yes."

"Look over there! Each house is short and squat with a row of windows, a row of front porch poles that holds the rooftop up." I giggled. "It is so pretty and different. The house is made from white colored wood. I don't know that there was any type of white colored trees."

"Yes, here."

The limousine slowed the air speed and halted within the air waves, slowly lowering down into the dirt, creating a set of dusty yellow tinted tornados and stopped on top of the ground.

I bounced up and down with excitement of a new adventure. "We're here. I'm so excited and nervous and happy and thrilled with all the other emotions." I sat back with a giggle and a grin beside Ucal. He reached over and held her hand with a smile into her nose profile. I smiled. "Are you excited, too?"

He nodded. "Yeah, I admit I am a little nervous. I have never spoken in front of strange people before."

I leaned over and slapped his bicep with a nod and a smile. "You'll do a great job. I will clap first."

He smiled. "Thanks."

The rear door of the limousine opened.

I slid out and stood in a plot of dirt with a gasp and a giggle. My pair of spiked high heeled sandal tips sunk down into the soft yellow soil.

Ucal slid over the bench seat and scooted out the limousine, standing next to Igala, shading his eyelids from the bright sun and stared ahead at the squat building.

The building was made of white wooden planks with a tin coated rooftop of a one-story structure. The front porch held a row of thin poles, a row of windows, a row of rocking chairs, and a row of marching baby ducklings with their brown colored mama in the lead that waddled over the flat wooden floor.

I giggled at the cute scene.

The archway of the short and squat building was open with a male inside the archway. The male possessed a tall and lean body frame of dark tinted skin with a cropped head of blonde hair and a pair of brown eyeballs. He wore a pair of long walking shorts and a pair of flip flops with a smile of missing teeth. He motioned with a hand and a nod to Igala and Ucal.

Ucal reached down and grabbed her hand with a smile and a nod to the male. "That's our host. We are to eat the breakfast meal and then make our presentation about Zulu Time."

I whispered with a fake smile. "All right..." I felt excessively overdressed in the stunning evening re-designer gown, wearing the elbow-length matching re-designer gloves and the re-designer purse that carried nothing inside and moved slightly behind Ucal. I lifted a naked arm and rubbed my face, wiping off most of the colored dots over my complexion, trying to fit in with the land people.

Ucal led them forward toward the open archway with a hand wave and a smile, stopping and standing in front of the male. "Hello. I am Ucal. This is Igala. We are from Society City Four. Thanks for inviting us into your fair city."

"Yeah, shore thing, young people! Come on in and grab a plate of food. It's breakfast time here before we start working the crop fields." The male held a series of scars over an eyebrow, one cheekbone, and on the chin with a set of missing teeth from a nice smile.

I gasped with a fake smile. "Hello!" I turned and smiled at the side of the front porch. Each rocking chair contained a set of furry animals.

One rocking chair held a mama cat and her nursing kittens. A second rocking chair held a mama dog and her playful puppies that were running around and jumping up and down into the chair on her.

A third chair held a flock of brown rabbits. There was a mama rabbit and all her baby rabbits were sleeping.

Ucal smiled at the male. "When I do start the presentation, sir?"

The male back stepped from the archway and turned with a smile of missing teeth, slowly moving to the first table of food. "When you finish your meal, there is a podium in the rear wall that ain't being used. You can talk from there." He stopped at the first table that was filled with trays of steaming food and reached over, grabbing an empty plate, filling the empty space with different food items and moved down to the second table of food.

The single room was very long and very wide inside the one story building. There was an array of numerous windows without the glass pane, exposing the outside elements to the interior room. The fresh breeze blew from the outside and created a nice cross-wind, cooling the room and the bodies.

Each wall contained numerous individual naked tables with numerous food trays. Above the table, the window pane was missing where the sunray shined down over the food. In front of each table, there were long row of numerous naked picnic tables that a set of four benches. Each bench held five people.

I moved inside and stopped, standing a few feet inside the room that was clearly a dining hall for eating meals. I expected to be greeted with a little girl and a bouquet of flowers but I was clearly wrong within my vivid imagination.

The rest of the land people were slumped over a platter of food eating.

Ucal shoved Igala forward on the collar bone with a smile and a whisper. "You start first, Igala. I will follow behind you."

I graciously swung around to face the wall of tables, smelling the delicious entrees and moved to the first long food table, grabbing a plate, shuffling down the table to each food tray. I continued to move down to each table and stopped in front of the table with sizzling and heated meats. The meats were varied in colors from pink, white, yellow and brown. I turned with a worried brow and stared out the window pane onto the front porch with a worried mind, thinking about the rabbit, wondering if the mammal was eaten. I turned back to the meats with a stern face and decided to skip the different types of meats, moving down to the next table. I selected certain items without appearing gluttonous, placing a food item over the stoneware with a smile.

Ucal filled the oval shaped plate fifty percent with a set of food items, feeling nervous about the upcoming speech and swing around with a smile, moving ahead toward an empty spot at the second picnic table from the wall of food tables. He sat down on the end bench at the head of the table and ate the food.

I graciously swung around in the long gown and moved ahead to the same picnic table with Ucal. There was an empty spot on the side bench. I placed the eating plate over the naked wood, looking down at the bench seat with a puzzled brow. I didn't want the bows in the back of my dress to become tore or ripped from the rough wood of the bench seat. So, I slid over the end of the bench seat and sat down, tucking the front of the dress underneath my legs, allowing the dress train with the pretty multiple colored girly bows to show over my back spine, down over the bench seat, and puddle onto the floor. The column of individual colored girly bows started at the top of the nape of the neck underneath the ponytail and flowed down toward the tip of the dress train. I reached over and placed the re-designer purse next to my eating plate like a good belle, removing each glove. I folded each re-designer glove and placed on top of the purse, grabbing the napkin and placed into a lap. I reached over and grabbed the fork, stabbing it into the food item.

The little girl with a dirty face sat next to Igala and turned with a set of missing teeth to smile at the chin of Igala. "I like your gloves."

I turned and swallowed the food with a smile and opened a mouth to see the brown hair roots of the little girl.

The second little girl with a dirty face sat beside the first little girl, leaning over into her plate of food and the other child's plate of food, shouting with a smile of missing teeth to see the chin of Igala. "I like your gloves."

"Thank you." I nodded to both the little girls and turned with a smile to Ucal. He had finished the breakfast meal and was fidgeting inside the edge of the bench seat. I reached over with a smile and patted his hand. "You finished eating. So, go on! Go and stand at the podium and get started with your speech. I will cover any individual questions on the floor at the tables."

"All right," Ucal stood from the bench with a nervous smile and back stepped from table with a wink to Igala, spinning around with a grin, turning and moved ahead to the podium with a nod. The podium was a skinny single wooden light colored pole with a small tilted tray that was made of white wood also. He stood in front of the podium with a smile and placed both hands over the tray, controlling his nerves. "Hello..."

The audience of land people continued to grunt and eat into the plate of food.

The first little girl spun around and shoved the second little girl from a face and the plate of food with a sneer. "I said it first. I liked her gloves."

The second little girl fell backward into the arm of the middle aged adult with a growl. "I said it first. I liked her gloves."

The first little girl reached over and shoved the second little girl with a sneer. "You said it second. I like her gloves. I said it first, me. I like her gloves."

Ucal smiled with a nod to each nose profile of the land people from the podium, shouting over the tings of the eating utensils with a nature voice. "I am Ucal. I came with my Zulu Time partner Igala. But I will go into greater details about Zulu Time later."

The second little girl looked up and smiled with a set of missing teeth to the adult. "Mom, I wanna gloves like that."

The middle aged female adult was the mom. She continued to eat the plate of food and wore a set of dirt and grass stained colored dress with a blistered and sunburned face, "All right, sweetheart."

"Are you sick? Why do you have bumps on your face?" The first little girl turned with a set of missing teeth to see the nose profile of Igala. The colored poker dots were still displayed on the lower sides of the cheekbones where she had missed with her arm wipe.

"No, I am fine." I turned with a gasp to see the plate of food and dropped the fork, reaching down, grabbing the napkin. I folded the napkin in half to the clean side and lifted it up, covering my eyeballs, cleaning off a face of embarrassment of pink tinted color. I heard the little girl giggle out loud and felt her shifting movement near my elbow while I was blinded with the napkin, continuing to clean off the colored dots.

The little girl reached over and grabbed the pair of gloves on top of the re-designer purse and stood upright from the shared bench seat, back stepping from Igala and turned, dashing away from the picnic table, Igala, and her mom with a giggle and grin.

The second little girl gasped in shock and stood upright, back stepping from the bench, turning and followed behind the back spine of her sister, moving away from the picnic table, Igala and her mom with a sour frown. "I wanna a glove."

I dropped the napkin down into a lap and turned with a gasp to see the pair of missing yellow colored gloves, looking back over a collar bone with a confused brow. The two little girls were sharing and wearing a re-designer glove on each arm with smiles and giggles. I swung a face back around with a smile to see my plate of food. The little girls were allowed to keep the re-designer gloves, remembering the day that the young people came from Society City Four.

A set of ten-year-old girls ran around the eating table and sat down between Igala and the mother of the previous children.

The little ten-year-old girl scooted closer to the arm of Igala with a dirty face and a set of scars over the cheekbones and turned with a set of missing teeth to smile at the chin of Igala. "I like your purse."

I turned and swallowed the food with a fake smile, looking down at the re-designer purse with a set of nervousness.

The second little ten-year-old girl with a dirty face sat beside the first little girl, leaning over into a plate of food and the other plate of food, shouting with a smile of missing teeth to Igala. "I like your purse."

"Thanks." I continued to stare down at the re-designer purse. The purse contained only flattened air. I held the collector bar inside the dress pouch for safekeeping like my mom had ordered. I wanted to reach up and snatch the purse but that would be foolish. I was teen. She was a young child.

Ucal continued to stand at the podium with a nervous smile and held both hands over the tray, controlling his nerves. "Igala only want into Zulu Time, because she was in a car accident. Then me and Igala went into Zulu Time when she called out the word, Tag...."

The audience of land people continued to eat the breakfast meal without engaging small talk.

The first ten-year-old girl spun around and shoved the second ten-year-old girl from a face and the plate of food with a sneer. "I said it first. I liked her purse."

The second ten-year-old girl fell backward into the arm of the middle aged adult with a growl. "I said it first. I liked her purse."

The first ten-year-old girl reached over and shoved the second ten-year-old girl with a sneer. "You said it second. I like her purse. I said it first, me. I like her purse."

The second ten-year-old girl spun around and smiled with a set of missing teeth to the adult. "Mom, I wanna a glove like that."

The middle aged female adult was the mom of the ten-year-old child. She continued to eat the plate of food and wore a set of dirt and grass stained colored dress with a blistered and sunburned face, "All right, sweetheart."

"Why do you wear colored dots on the side of your face?" The first ten-year-old girl turned with a giggle and a set of missing teeth to see the nose profile of Igala. The lower cheekbone near the earlobes still displayed a couple of the colored dots from the cleaning.

I rolled my eyeballs and stared down at the beverage, since I was not falling for that trick, again. I reached out and grabbed the tumbler of red liquid, lifting and sipping.

The ten-year-old girl laughed out loud and shifted closer to the arm of Igala, reaching out, grabbing the re-designer purse from the table and stood upright, back stepping from the bench, turning and dashed away from the picnic table, Igala, and her mom with a giggle and grin.

The second ten-year-old girl gasped in shock and stood upright, back stepping from the bench, turning and followed behind the back spine of her sister, moving away from the picnic table, Igala and her mom with a sour frown. "I wanna the purse."

I dropped the beverage, spilling it over the naked table and turned with a gasp to see the missing re-designer purse, looking back over a collar bone with a confused brow. The first ten-year-old girl held been very smart and outfoxed Igala, running out through the open archway and held the purse above her dirty hair roots into the air with a laugh. The second ten-year-old girl dashed behind the back spine of the first girl with a sour frown and a yell. I swung a face back around with a fake smile to see Ucal. The two girls could keep the re-designer purse. I was not going to make a teen scene over the item as I remembered when I visited Society City Three.

Ucal continued to stand and lean into the podium, staring at the nose profile of each land person, shouting out the words. "Before I talk about the important word tag, I would like to say that Zulu Time is sometimes fun. Each person dresses up for Zulu Time ball that comes with food, music, fancy gowns, and dancing..."

A set of teen girls ran around the table and sat down between Igala and the mother of the previous children.

I turned with a gasp to see the two girls, who stared back at my worried face.

One of the teen girls had a set of missing teeth and numerous scars over both eyebrow, both cheekbones, and the side of the jaw line. She smiled without the teeth. "I love your hair bow."

I dropped the fork and reached up with a fake smile, touching the hair bow with a nod to her. "Thanks."

Ucal continued to stand with a fake smile at the podium, rubbing both hands over the smooth wood. "Before you are admitted into the ball, you must paint your eye sockets like a raccoon. It is called raccoon eyes. It takes me hours to paint my face so perfectly like a raccoon. I bet you have raccoons here too. Zulu Time starts at five in the afternoon and lasts for hours, sometimes until midnight."

The second teen girl with a dirty face, a set of numerous scars over both eyebrow and a set of missing teeth scooted beside the first teen girl, leaning over into a plate of food and the other plate of food, shouting with a smile of missing teeth to Igala. "I like your hair bow."

I nodded with a fake smile of worry and held the hair bow over my hair strands. "Thanks."

The first teen girl turned and shoved the second teen girl from a face and the plate of food with a sneer. "I said it first. I liked her hair bow."

The second teen girl fell backward into the arm of the middle aged adult with a growl. "I said it first. I liked her hair bow."

The first teen girl reached over and shoved the second teen girl with a sneer. "You said it second. I like her hair bow. I said it first, me. I like her hair bow."

The second teen old girl spun around and smiled with a set of missing teeth to the adult. "Mom, I wanna a hair bow like that."

The middle aged female adult was the mom of the teenager also. She continued to eat the plate of food and wore a set of dirt and grass stained colored dress with a blistered and sunburned face, "All right, sweetheart."

"I wanna a girly hair bow." The first teen girl stood from the bench with a snigger and back stepped from the table with a grin.

I gasped with fear and held both hands over my hair bow. I could have removed the hair bow and given to one teenager, but I only possessed on one single hair bow.

The second teen girl stood from the bench with a chuckle and back stepped from the table, staring down at the hair bow inside the hair strands of Igala with a sissy whine. "I wanna a hair bow."

Ucal continued to stand and lean into the podium, staring at the nose profile of each land person, shouting out the words. "I would like to mention that we live in a very criminal city..."

The second little girl spun around and smiled with a set of missing teeth down at the hair roots of the adult. "Mom, I wanna a hair bow like that."

The middle aged mom of the teenager continued to eat the plate of food and wore a set of dirt and grass stained colored dress with a blistered and sunburned face, "All right, sweetheart."

I turned with a gasp to see the nose profile of the middle aged woman, who was the mother of the six females. Then, the two teen girls leaned over and snatched a girly bow from the back of Igala's dress, swinging around and dashed through the open door of the building, escaping with the bow.

Then, a set of new teen girls ran around the eating table of Igala without stopping, thrusting out a dirty hand and ripped off one of the girly bows from the rear fabric of her dress.

I gasped in shock and felt the pull of each bow from the rear of the fabric, flinging a face forward and down into the plate of food, coming from the rear end attack with a hardy grunt and missed the pile of food. Thank goodness!

The mother of the rude and ill-mannered children and the teens continued to eat the plate of food without speaking or yelling or correcting the females.

Ucal continued to stand at the podium with a fake smile to each nose profile of each land person. "Now, I have come to the really important part of my story. Zulu Time is the place and the time...

"Time is done." One of the male stood upright from the bench seat with a smile of missing teeth and a face of scars, lifting both arms into the air with a nod. "Start the music! It's time for the morning hoedown dancing before we head out to the crops of foods to work. Yeehaw!"

Each land person stood upright from the bench seat and leaned over the table surface with the dirty dishes, shuffling the eating table toward the wall with the long food tables, preparing for the upcoming dance.

I stood upright from the bench seat with a fake smile in silence and hold the tears of humiliation, back stepping from the table and the plate of food. The adults at her table stood upright and shuffled the table and the bench toward the side wall. I continued to stand in the middle of the floor in confusion.

Ucal back stepped with a gasp and a sour frown from the podium, turning and marched forward toward Igala and reached out, grabbing her hand with a huff of annoyance. "We're done here, now."

I felt the touch of Ucal and spun around with him with a puff, swiftly moving over the floor in silence toward the open archway of the building.

At the limousine airship among the warm temperatures with dull sunshine, the door was open and ready for the young couple. The driver held the door with a nod in silence to Ucal and Igala.

Ucal and I scooted inside the rear bench seating. I bounced over the far window with a sad face.

He scooted in the middle of the seat with a sour frown and halted, looking down with an angry face at both hands. "The land people are barbaric. Zulu Time is barbaric. The entire Society is barbaric."

I reached down and touched the skirt of my gown with a sad face. "They ripped off all the tiny bows on my back of my dress. The teen girls were so rude and ill-mannered. I have never met such ugly and mean peoples."

He exhaled and stared with a sour frown down at both hands. "This is the reason we came here to share our tale of Zulu Time."

I pushed a finger through one of the many holes inside the ruined re-designer dress. "Then the little girls stole my gloves without asking for permission. Their faces were dirty like their hands. I don't want the new pair of re-designer gloves back even if the authorities find them."

He exhaled and stared down at both hands. "The citizens should be intrigued and interested in hearing about the real victims of Zulu Time. Us, me and you, we fought and won in Zulu Time."

I exhaled and rubbed my face with a pair of naked and greasy hands from the plate of food, dropping them into a lap with a frown. "Then, the pre-teen girls stole my purse. Well, they can have it. I don't want it back either."

He exhaled and stared with a sour frown down at both hands. "We were the criminals. You were a victim. Zulu Time labeled us criminals, but we were the victims of this Zulu Time madman."

I slapped both hands over the ruined re-designer dress with a smile. The tour provided a new dress for each event. I wasn't really worried about ruining the dress. Her mom Henoana was worried about her daughter Igala ruining the dress. I turned with a giggle and smiled at the strawberry blonde colored hair roots of Ucal. "Well, this is only the first Society City. I don't expect perfection or cooperation from the local natives. And I didn't see a wall of glass inside the dining hall that showed a single entertainment program. Maybe, you and I can rotate back after we have told the Zulu Time story to the other Society Cities."

He continued to stare with a sour frown at both hands. "There is no crime in bumping into a car. There is no crime when the damaged car is paid. There is no crime when no one individual gets hurt."

I leaned over with a smile and touched his arm. "I concur with all that. We are here. And we are done with the Tour of Zulu Time presentation for the day and the night. So, we can go and explore around Society City Three for the rest of the afternoon. I've never been to a real farm site with a set of baby animals. And we can share our personal feelings. We can walk and talk about this thing. I really need to express my stress, my frustration, my concerns. Do you, too?"

Ucal looked up with a sour frown to see the rear skull of the driver. "We are going to the hotel building where we have been assigned a room for the rest of the day and the night. I got Hall homework to do, so I can graduate and become a Regulator."

I turned with a sour frown and viewed the landscape out my side window. There were columns of crops of colored food between hills of yellow wildflowers. I whispered for my eardrums only. "I don't wanna be a Regulator ever."

The limousine slowed and halted in the air waves, slowly dropping down from the sky and landed in front of a new building. The driver moved from the seat and stood at the rear door.

The four stories tall building was made of white wooden planks with a set of four tall columns on the flat front porch. The porch contained a row of windows, a row of varied chairs, including sitting chairs and rocking chairs. Each chair contained an animal that was curled up and asleep.

The limousine door opened.

I slid out and stood upright inside the dirt with a smile, turning with a confused brow to see him down inside the cabin. I leaned down with a puzzled brow to see his nose profile. "Are you coming inside the building, Ucal?"

Ucal looked down with a stern face and typed on the com-d screen. "Naw, I gotta find the team of Regulators and tell them what happened this morning at the Zulu Time presentation. You can choose any room that you want. The door automatic opens based on your heat signature and then registers your odor." He laughed.

I smiled at his nose profile. "Fine, me, the door, and my odor will have some fun, this afternoon."

"Okay..." he laughed.

I stood upright with a soft giggle.

The vehicle door closed shut. The driver turned and moved back into the driver's seat. Then, the limousine lifted up from the dirt and flew a few feet over the yellow dirt and through the air toward another building in the far distance.

I stood in the heated sunshine in front of the local hotel building.

My home town of Society City Four was not so hot and bright with rays of pretty yellow sunlight. I wanted to toss both arms into the air and wiggle out a pink tongue from my lips at the moving limousine and an annoying Ucal, but restrained my set of girly teen hormones. I spun around to face the building and waltzed ahead with a sour frown through an open archway.

None of the archways held a solid door or a glass window on the wall. But the breeze was cool and fresh on my sweaty face and my sweaty body.

The interior room was designed with more white wooden planks and more rocking chairs. Each rocking chair held another sleeping mammal.

I strolled ahead with a giggle toward the center staircase of white wood, gathering the front of the dress and marched up the steps. The staircase ended with a solid wall of white wood. I turned to the side to see a single metal white colored door, closed. Then, I turned to the other side to see another single metal white colored door, closed. I exhaled with a puff of annoyance and turned to the right, marching ahead to the single door and stopped.

The metal door opened from the heat signature.

I entered and stopped a few feet from the door with a sneer.

The door automatically closed behind my back spine.

He sat inside the loveseat of white wood on top of the thick butthole padding of dark colors of purple, red, and green with a smile, "Where are your painted raccoon-eyes?"

I stood in place with a grin and a giggle at Dfee. "They eliminated the makeup for all the flash bulbs on my pretty smile."

"Yeah, you have a pretty smile, beauty." He was a tall teen male with nice smile, a new head of cropped dark brown hair, a tone of yellow tinted skin, a pair of light mint green eyeballs, a face of brown dusted whiskers, and a pair of rippled muscles underneath the tight T-shirt.

I parked both hands on the hips with a gasp. "What are your doing inside my private suite?"

"Technique, I'm inside the sitting room. I am sitting in the room, not your cozy warm bedroom." He thumbed back over a collar bone toward the open archway of the other room, the private bedroom.

I stood in place with a sneer and a sour frown. "How did you get into my private sitting room? You must leave, Dfee. You and I will get in trouble here inside the hotel building."

He stood with a smile, wearing a pair of ripped and faded blue jeans, a white shirt and a pair of polished cowboy boots of brown and black, advancing to her. "We're teens. Teens didn't get into trouble."

I gasped with a laugh. "Then how did you know that this particular room is mine? I mean, I just finished breakfast with the land people and Ucal..."

"Where is Ucal?" He stopped and stood with a smile in front of her face.

"Checking in with the Regulators," I gasped with a worried brow. "He will find us. I mean you. I mean the Regulators will find you here with me..."

"Naw, I wanna be here."

"Why not?"

He reached out and grabbed both her hands with a wink and a smile. "I'm stealing you away from your suite and the life of bondage to the Regulator."

I giggled. "Regulators are really pretty and shiny golden tinted."

He leaned down near her lips with a smile and a chuckle. "I'm your shiny armor guard or knight or light or right guy." He kissed her lips, pulling back with a wink and a smile.

I exhaled with the lovely touch of his soft lips and a tongue of mint sweet breath with a puzzled brow. "Stealing me to where? We are located inside a luxury suite on the fourth floor of a tall building with a set of missing glass." I gasped. "We can't jump out the window. And we can't go through the open archway together. We could be seen."

"You're smart, beauty." He moved backward with a chuckle toward the cozy bedroom.

I gasped. "I can't go inside there with you. Look, I need to change my gown. It got ruined during breakfast."

"Yeah, you can change outta of your gown into your birthday suite. That would please my teenly hormones very well." He stopped and stood beside a side closet with a closed door.

I gasped. "What?"

He smiled. "You don't have any luggage here. I checked and double-checked."

"You checked for my personal luggage, why?"

"Yeah, I wanted a souvenir."

I gasped. "What type of souvenir from my luggage, Dfee?"

"Something very personal and intimate of you..."

I frowned. "Why isn't my luggage here?"

He winked. "The limousine ain't here. Ucal ain't here. So, I guess that Ucal wanted something personal and intimate from your luggage, too."

I looked down with a sour frown at the floor. "Yeah, he drove away inside the limousine with my luggage. I guess I will wear my gown until I see my luggage, again." I turned and smiled at the closet. "We stopped. So, your secret make-out room is the broom closet."

"No, but that's a good one, beauty." He chuckled. "There is a secret door inside this thin looking side closet. Then, we escape from the building and become free from the antebellum Regulators."

"How do you know this, Dfee?"

He released her hand and reached over, lifting up the com-d from the pocket of the blue jeans and near his smile. "In the ancient days, the building was a hotel where the food was delivered to each suite." He shoved the com-d back into the pocket of the jeans and reached over, opening the door. The door slid sideways and revealed a small empty space. He reached up and pulled down the lever. The space became occupied with a moving carriage. He pointed the carriage with a smile. "Stuff your tuff inside, beauty."

I gasped. "I can't fit me and a dress into that small carriage. I could suffocate and die..."

"...in my arms that will be our final hour together at the end of our lives at 113 years old until we reach the afterlife. And then, we will still be together." He reached out with a chuckle and touched her waist, lifting Igala with his man-strength into the air. She reached out and touched the lip, crawling inside the small carriage of the food service elevator that normally held a set of food trays. She twisted around the squared shape enclosed space with a sour frown. "I..."

He reached up and pulled down the lever with a smile and a wink.

The small elevator slowly dropped down without making my stomach sick. Then, the carriage landed on the floor and as, I heard the familiar sounds. The rats scurried around with tiny mice squeaks, "The dungeon." I whispered with a sour frown and crawled forward on both palms and shoes, dragging the gown behind my butthole and stood upright in front of a solid wall of white wood

The back spine of Dfee appeared and landed on top of the carriage rooftop with a loud thump and a chuckle, twisting around with a grin and jumped down onto the floor with a smile. "We leave the small food elevator carriage down here on the ground floor. So, you can move back up into your private suite much later tonight..."

I frowned, "Ucal?"

He cuddled her and turned, strolling ahead toward the open archway with a grin into her cheekbone. "Ucal will never know about us, it, you, and me. He will be sound asleep after eating and burping up his food, since he was three years old, which is a very disgusting childhood behavior."

I frowned. "You are so poetic."

They moved through the open archway into an outdoor scene of rows of low plants bushes, tall trees, pretty wildflowers, the clear skyline and the bright sunlight.

Outdoors among the warm temperatures with bright sunshine along a yellow tinted dirt pathway between groves of matching yellow woodland trees with white tinted plants, I turned and stared at the strange objects. "Where are all the land people?" There were short and squat white buildings in the far distance on one side. On the other side, there were rows of rows of colorful crop fields with food.

"They will finish up the breakfast dance moves and then scoot into the farm equipment, harvesting the food stuffs. This place provides food stuffs to all the other Society Cities." He stopped and leaned down, pulling out the green vines with a set of tiny pink buds from the short plant bush, standing upright and whipped it into a circular flower headband, reaching over, crowning her with a smile and a chuckle. "I official dub thee, my beauty."

I turned and reached down, grabbing and jerked a full rose from the stem and swung around, slamming the rose into his forehead with a grin and a giggle, "I official dub thee, my beast."

"Grr!" He leaned over and cuddled her, sniffing her flora perfumed neck with a smile.

They cuddled and slowly strolled over the yellow dirt, alone and together.

"How did you know that room was mine?" I occasionally looked back over a collar bone to see a Regulator but found nothing and turned around, reaching out, touching the smooth leaves of trees, the soft pedals of flowers, and the rough thorns of low bushes.

He chuckled, "Girls on the right. Boys on the left. A boy always escorts a girl on his right side, except during the marriage ceremony. Then, the girl stands on the guy's left side forever and a day."

I giggled. "How do you know about that information?"

"The com-d has lots of useless and useful information, if you know where to look."

"How do you know about the land people?"

"The com-d has lots of useless and useful information, if you know where to look."

"Why are the faces of the land people scarred? Is that a ritual?"

"No, they plow and harvest the fields with a set of wild equipment. Sometimes, the metal equipment arms and limbs get detached and then the fleshy face gets marred."

I frowned. "That is so sad. They work really hard for a living. Why do they do it?"

"No choice here. Society City Three is a working farm with a batch of farmers for food. This is their life and livelihood."

"Why would a person chose this life?"

He laughed. "Why would a person chose death inside Zulu Time?"

"Right! What are you going to do after Hall?"

He chuckled. "Be one dimensional."

I smiled "What does that mean?"

He chuckled. "Some folks say we live our life as one dimensional."

"But, the world is presented in three dimensions of width, depth, height. How can a person be one dimensional?"

"Becoming a re-gen, the work is re-designing something that someone has already created. The repeating pattern makes people one dimensional. So, I guess from an intellectual point of view a person can't be creative. They just do the same thing over and over again until the day they die."

I frowned. "Yeah, I see. It is like my parents. They are re-generators of something." I turned and smiled at his grin. "I don't know what my parents re-design for their work jobs."

"There, you go. A good example of the one-dimensional man and woman with a set of one dimensional kids," chuckling.

I frowned. "I don't wanna be one dimensional. How would I prevent becoming that?"

"You can't escape it." He smiled.

"I can escape it. I will escape it. Don't you want to be something else besides a standard re-gen job?"

He cuddled her, "I wanna be one dimensional happy. That's all!"

"And how will you accomplish that, Dfee?"

"Becoming a cowboy with a horse ranch, but I need some land. If I work wisely, I might be able to save and buy some property. But, a horse ranch needs a cowgirl." He leaned over and kissed her cheekbone, pulling back with a smile, caressing her hand.

I frowned. "How about becoming a Regulator? They like young folks, recruiting young people for a good job. I guess until the end of time."

He smiled. "No. They got a tough job. I wanna do something easy."

"Do you think that the Regulators destroy people? They regulate Zulu Time where the victims and criminals live or die."

He exhaled. "Zulu Time is needed. It controls people from becoming criminals. My grandfather used to talk about the evil in this world, when folks died for no good reason but greed and vanity of property and money. Now, Zulu Time reminds folks that a greedy act means good-bye for the entire bear clan." He chuckled.

I stopped and turned with a sneer to see his face. "I was inside Zulu Time. I didn't do anything wrong but crinkle a rear bumper of a car."

He leaned over and cuddled her with a smile. "And that is done and over with. You won, fair and square, and all that. Minki, she was a wrong-way witch, which is putting it mildly. She wrongly claimed Zulu Time on you and your family when you hit that other car. Why did you hit that other car? Can't you drive a car, beauty? Tell you what? I will come and drive you to school, to home, to the park, to the church for our wedding." He smiled.

I shook my curls with a sour frown. "Minki was inside my car with me as a passenger in the front seat. I was at fault hitting the other car."

He reached over with a smile and grabbed her hand, swinging it back and forward, moving ahead over the dirt. "O! That's strangely weird. Usually, the victim is the other driver at fault. Hmm, the parents of Minki did that. That is the way Zulu Time works. Kids under the age of eighteen are minors in the eyeballs of Society. We are protected by our parents. The parents of Minki screwed up that decision and died. End of a tragic tale. You and your parents are not that dumb, beauty. They know what they want in life."

"They do. They are good parents to me."

"And I know what I want and who I want."

"Who?" I giggled.

He swung her hand back and forth with a smile. "I wanna graduate, be a re-gen, get married, have a kid, grow old, and finally die happily."

"Me, too," I cuddled into his chest.

He released her hand and dashed ahead with a grin, turning and stood in front of the objects. He reached over and patted the object with a nod and a chuckle.

I frowned, "Horses?"

The horses were saddled and ready for riding with a set of guiding reins. Each horse was tied to a bale of yellow hay, grazing down onto a set of tiny plants inside the yellow dirt.

Dfee smiled. "This is a horse barn with a set of horses that are eager to ride with the wind." He placed one foot on the hay with a nod and extended by both hands to Igala.

I moved ahead with a giggle for my selected horse. I could ride the back spine on the horse but not normally in a three-foot long evening gown. He reached over and lifted her into his lips first, kissing her face and pulled back with a smile, lifting her up and onto the saddle with a grunt. I spread the gown around the mane of horse that flowed down over the rump of horse, smoothing the silk away from the legs, covering the horse with yellow silky beauty.

He stood in place and looked up with a smile to see Igala. "You are so pretty. You look like a princess on top of the white horse, of course."

I reached over and lifted the reins with a smile. "Where are we going?"

He spun around with a smile and swiftly mounted the second horse with a chuckle, lifting up the reins, swinging around with a wink to see her. "Race you to the pond!"

I leaned down with a grin into smooth horse hair with a giggle as a good rider. "I don't know the location of the pond."

"The mare does. Loosen the reins. She'll follow her stable mate." Dfee leaned down into the horse hair and kicked the horse with a grunt and a chuckle. The stallion leaped into the air and fell down into the soft dirt, kicking the yellow dirt into the air waves, galloping and leaped over each low plant and bush toward the south direction.

The mare that Igala rode soared over the dirt and followed behind the rump of the first horse on the same pathway, jumping over each low plant and flower bush.

The stallion slowed and halted over the yellow grass, stopping at the edge of murky pond that was covered in white lilies and brown frogs.

Dfee slid off the horse and spun around, dashing to Igala.

I lifted upright a torso and slowed the horse, jerking the reins backward. "Whoa, horse!" The horse stopped and dropped down a mouth, grazing down on the grass.

He stopped and stood next to her horse, extending both arms into the air toward Igala. I slid off and fell down from the saddle and into his arms, slamming into his body with a grin and giggle. He coughed with pain of the violent downward body collision with Igala and a grunt, "Caught me, a beauty!"

I turned and frowned at the pond and the hills. "Where are we?"

He spun them to face the hills with a smile and moved forward with a chuckle, "The biggest hill top is right over yonder."

I gasped and moved with him, slapping the skirt of the dress with a sour frown. "The top of the hill, I can't climb up a hill top in a gown."

He wrapped an arm around her waist and lifted her feet from the grass with a smile into his rib cage, climbing the hillside. "You can do anything in that gown, beauty." He stopped and stood in place, dropping her at the edge of the slope on the hillside and released her hand. He leaped into the air from the edge of the hill first with a loud yell and landed down onto the sloping hill with a grunt, rolling completely down into a thick patchy of white colored wildflowers and stood upright. He spun around with a smile and wiped the yellow dirt and white flowers from the clothing without seeing her." Jump, roll, and stand. Easy, beauty!"

I crossed both biceps with a sour frown and a matching tone. "No, I am not jumping from the edge. No, I am rolling down in this dress. And, no, I am not..."

He looked up with a smile and extended both arms, moving closer to the bottom of the hill with a nod and a chuckle. "You have more cushion-fluff inside that big old dress than slender me. Jump, beauty! I'll catch you. I promise."

"No, you're too far away, Dfee." I stared down with a worried brow at the landscape of flowers. "There is nothing down here but a patch of yellow meadows and colorful wildflowers, Dfee. What is there to do or see down there? I'm really confused here about visiting a meadow."

"I promise. There is something to do and to see. Come on down, beauty! I wanna show it to you."

"No."

"Back up three paces then run like doe, then leap like frog. Fling both your arms like a bird then roll into a fast ball but don't hit your skull, because that'll hurt. So, just land on one shoulder, beauty."

I frowned. "Do you like to hunt beasties?"

He smiled. "I love to hunt beauties. Join me, Igala! Come on, girl. I have all day and all night before sunrise, tomorrow morning."

I uncrossed my arms with a gasp. "What is happening tomorrow morning?"

He nodded with a smile. "I'm leaving from here."

"O yeah, I'm leaving from here, too."

"So, we only got today. Jump into my arms, beauty!"

"Fine," I back stepped three paces, exhaling with a puff of nerves and inhaled with a huff of worry, dashing forward and leaped into the air from the edge of the hill with a loud scream. I fell forward and flapped both arms and then tuck my body into a roll, hitting a shoulder on the soft meadow grass with a loud moan. I continued roll forward and finally stopped, resting on my back spine, feeling a cushion of soft velveteen from the white colored wildflowers.

Dfee back stepped and watched her fly from the edge of the hill and stopped, running ahead and stopped, standing over her with a chuckle. "The meadow is soft. It's a special blend of weeds and grass which is soft like a kitten and tall like a bush."

"Ah." I moved and spread apart both legs and both arms making a fairy figure inside the flowers.

Dfee leaned down and gently landed on top of her, kissing her lips, foreverly.

Hotel building location

Entrance lobby setting

06:56 pm

(Early evening, Society City Four Time Zone)

The driver moved through the open archway and stood in front of Ucal, shaking a skull with a stern face. Then, the driver side stepped and scooted around the front bumper of the vehicle, entering and prepared to leave the hotel building. The limousine lifted from the dirt and flew forward to park inside another building from the wind, heat, and sunshine.

Ucal stood in front of the limousine and faced the open archway of the hotel building with a sigh of disappointment. Igala was not inside her private bedroom resting and watching her com-d. He knew where she was and he didn't like it but accepted it with honor.

Ucal had been with his parents and the other Regulators, talking about the bad presentation of the Zulu Time speak to the farmers of Society City Three.

He wiped the sweat from a forehead and strutted ahead with a sour frown through an open archway.

None of the archways held a glass door or a glass window on the wall. But the breeze was cool and fresh on his sweaty face and his sweaty body.

The interior room was designed with more white wooden planks and more rocking chairs. Each rocking chair held another sleeping mammal, such like, a cat, a dog, a rabbit, a weasel, or a bird.

He strolled ahead with a sour frown toward the center staircase of white wood and marched up the steps to the second floor. The staircase ended with a solid wall of white wood. He whispered for his eardrums only. "Boys on the left," he spun to the left side to see a single door with a huff of annoyance at Dfee, marching ahead toward the closed archway and stopped.

The metal door opened from his heat signature.

Inside his private suit with outside warm temperatures and dull sunshine, Ucal moved through the sitting room, ignoring the new buffet of steaming food on the wall. The door automatically closed behind his back spine. He entered the bedroom and stopped a few feet from a nicely decorated bed mattress with a sneer, looking down with a sour frown to the com-d, hearing the familiar music. "Zulu Time was starting. I guess me and you are companions, tonight, Zulu Time darling. Dfee, you will be gone from her and here, tomorrow. I promise with crossed hearts and crossed swords by the redneck code." He lifted and climbed onto the top of the nice set of bedcovers, getting the orange colored fabric dirty with a pair of dirtier cowboy boots without a care, lifting and brought the com-d into a sour face to watch the program for the night.

Society City Four

07:01 pm (early evening)

Zulu Time Building location

Interior tan colored room setting

Warm temperatures and cloudy sky

The music played a new jazzy musical song on the tiny screen of his com-d, showing red and green wiggling lines. The screen wiggled and changed into a row of large and small oval shaped objects, standing against a tan colored rear wall inside the room of Zulu Time.

Jackie Jones stood beside her sister without twirling around, wearing a tight fighting coppery golden colored one-piece jumpsuit like one of the Regulators. She said with a sneer and a sour frown at the wall of objects. "Within Society City Four, there are not any more crimes of passion, crimes of thievery, and crimes of poverty. We each have a nice family unit, a home of beautiful re-gen possessions, and plenty of food on top of the supper table. However, there continues to be a crime against our beautiful city and the lush pretty green and brown woodlands. The wall of criminals is guilty of starting a forest fire that has burned one hundred acres of our precious woodlands down to the ground and killed the precious wildlife."

Jaime wore the same outfit, saying to the wall of criminals with a sneer and a sour frown. "Thus, each member of the family unit has been found guilty of the crime. And each member of the family unit is mounted in the colors of tan and red on the wall of criminals, tonight. Thus, the wall of criminals receives automatic death sentence by the Regulators without a justification case within Zulu Time."

Each female spun around with a sneer and marched ahead toward the opposite side, entering the shadow of an open door, swinging around to see the wall of criminals.

Inside the private suit of Ucal, he rested on top of the messy bed and watched the com-d with a laugh and a grin. "You go, girls, and tattle on these bad criminals, yeah." The wall contained a row of large and small objects which represented every adult, teen, and children of the family unit.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the camera panned backward to expose the entire tan colored Zulu Time room.

A line of glittery coppery golden colored Regulators marched ahead from each open archway and stopped, standing in front of the low and long sitting bench, aiming a cold barrel at each criminal on the forward wall.

Each twin stood inside the archway of the door with a sneer at the wall of criminals, saying in unison. "Aim higher..."

Each door slid down and closed.

Each Regulator pressed a trigger, releasing an array of bullets. The tan colored tape turned into rich black hues of color on each oval shaped object with a set of soft sounds of huffs, puffs, and grunts. Then, the row of objects wiggled and stilled in death.

The side doors slid upward and opened.

Both Jackie and Jaime moved ahead and stopped, standing behind the line of Regulators with a sour frown and a sneer in unison at the wall of dead criminals. "It is done. This is not the conclusion of Zulu Time. There are more justification cases to come. Stay tuned and thank you for watching Zulu Time."

The com-d screen went black with a new song of classical music with a set of vertical lines in the colors of blue and purple for a few minutes.

Inside the bedroom of Ucal, he tossed an arm into the air with a smile, dropping it down onto the bed with a soft thud. "It is well done. Citizens are so stupid when they continue to destroy the landscape. It is against the law to harm a human, a pet, a wild animal, a tree, and a car. I can't wait to be a Regulator and enforce these same legal laws, too. My mom missed the action tonight, since she is here to protect me and Igala."

The com-d screen changed and showed the tan color of the Zulu Time. The forward wall was empty and newly freshly tan colored, too.

A set of two doors opened.

A pale skinned female exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female exited from the second side door. Both females scooted across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated in a tight circle around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jackie and Jaime Jones."

Jackie slowly twirled around in a tight circle in a short body fitting sleeveless sheath dress of golden tint with a matching pair of golden tinted thigh high boots with a forehead, a neck, and both arms of greenery vines of tiny dark green leaf designs and a head ponytail of zigzag red, green, brown and golden colors with a smile and a nod to see each glass screen. "I am Jackie. Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice. We will explain the rules for any new audience viewers. When an injustice has occurred, each party is presented here inside the Zulu Time building."

Jamie slowly twirled in a tight circle in a short body fitting sleeveless sheath dress of white with an aqua rope-like colored belt and a matching pair of white colored thigh boots. Her forehead and her neck flexed with a band of tiny Greek symbols design. Her black hair draped down a back spine with a vivid colors of purple, dark blue, maroon, and yellow in the format of wiggling colored lines. "I am Jamie. Then each party is allowed to voice their justification case within a twenty-second time limit in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your suppertime meal. After the twenty seconds has expired, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for criminal or the letter of V for victim."

Each female spun around with a smile moved back to a closed door on the opposite side of the Zulu Time room.

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Three, he smiled down at the com-d. "Wow, the girls have a set of new outfits. They ditched the long skirts for a short skirt and a pair of high boots, showing off more legs. Wow, they look great, too. I wonder if I could get my girl Igala to dump her jeans for a short skirt, too. I'll ask her when we finish the Tour of Zulu Time and then get married as a newly wedded couple. She would do anything for me. She loves me."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the Cee door opened first.

Jamie swung around and strolled from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of five people in front of a long bench of soft fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of smiles, finger pointing at each tiny glass screen, wearing the formal attire in the color of red. Each face was decorated with a hollow outline of a set of yellow and black bumblebees.

The Vee door opened next.

Jackie spun around and strolled away from the second open archway with a smile, leading a line of five people in front of the same bench and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of mumbles and grunts, turning and pointing to each tiny television plasma screen on the curved wall, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of coral tinted color. Each face was decorated with a set of colorful green and black outline of an owl.

Jamie and Jackie spun around and met in middle with a smile and a nod, twirling in series of tight circles with a hand wave to see each glass screen.

Jackie stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, stopping the whirl, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of soft coral. My twin sister Jamie stands behind to Cee team. The Vee team claims that the son of the very large family parks his old rusty hover car in front of the Vee team family driveway which blocks access into the Vee team garage. The adult family members have kindly asked the son and the father of the Cee team to stop parking the old rusty hover car on their property and cease the action without any type of violence touch or any type of nice resolution. The Vee team family demands just and justice. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team."

Jamie stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone. "I am Jamie. I stand behind the Cee team of vivid red. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty seconds time period. Since, each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jackie turned with a smile and handed the microphone to the father of the Cee team in the first position of the column. Her sister Jamie turned and handed her microphone to the male of the Vee team in the first position of the row. They back stepped from the bench and the two debating teams, standing inside an empty spot on the wall, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The elderly father of the Vee team wore a coral colored tuxedo with a light blue bowtie and a pair of matching hand gloves. On his face, there were numerous hollow outlines of yellow and black tinted bumblebees. He lifted the microphone to the lips and jabbed a finger at the male of the Cee team with a sneer and as, he barely heard the musical hum of the bees on a painted face. The fun face paint sung and moved with the bones of the face. "That boy parks that old rusty hover car in the driveway of our home. It is not our rusty hover car. And the car smokes in black plumes and backfires in red sparks. Sometimes, the hover car is there for days."

Inside the private suite of Ucal of Society City Three, he frowned down at the com-d screen. "Geez, you should set the car on fire. Then all your worries and problems are solved, if the car is really on your property, sir." Ucal laughed.

The middle aged male of the Cee team wore a red colored tuxedo with a white bowtie and a pair of matching hand gloves and a solid black and green outline of an owl on each cheekbone. He lifted up and smiled into the pre-offered microphone. "You don't own a hover car, old man. You don't use the garage, old man. You can't fly a hover car, old man. You don't ever leave your house, old man. You use the public hover cars. So, my son is using up the space, since it is a waste, not to use the space." He chuckled. "Thus, you are stupid, old man. Your entire family will die here in Zulu Time. Then, I will own your space, your place, and the driveway," laughing.

The room went black as the voices faded into silence.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie smiled within the darkness in unison. "The twenty second deadline has expired."

Jackie smiled within the darkness. "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please, vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only.

Jamie smiled within the darkness. "If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl."

They smiled within the darkness in unison. "The voting is finished. Please illuminate all the glass screens now inside Zulu Time."

All the tiny glass screens showed a black back ground with one single letter in white.

Jamie smiled in the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Geez, I am shocked. Are your shocked, Jackie?"

Jackie smiled in the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Wow, I am shocked. Are you shocked, too, Jamie?"

Jamie and Jackie smiled within the darkness in unison, "The highest mathematical number wins the justification case inside the Zulu Time room which is the letter V for the victim team."

The tiny glass screens went black.

The dark room echoed in a series of screams and curses plus the sounds of rips and tears of fabric. Then the room was silence.

The lights illuminated inside the room.

On the forward wall, there were six objects that stood in height from the tallest down to the shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages, coming from the hair roots down to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

Jackie twirled around in a tight circle to see each screen with a smile and a nod. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, each Vee team member must participate and accept the judgment of Zulu Time. Thus, the Cee team has lost the justification case. Now, each Cee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of beige and the pretty color of red against the rear wall for justice. Each Cee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment, too. Thus, the Cee team is sentenced to death by means of the Vee team's fun and creative methods on the wall of criminals of Zulu Time."

Jamie swirled around in a tight circle to see each glass screen with a smile and a nod. "Vee team, please select your pleasure. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. Pick out whatever suites your heart and your hand. This part of Zulu Time is choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Cee team member must fire one weapon at one oval shaped object and kill the wiggling object on the forward wall. A Cee team member will know a kill shot has occurred when the oval shaped object has turned into the color of rich black, covering the tan or red tape. And I do believe that our evening audience is filled with people who love their driveways, making the Vee team win tonight."

In front of the long bench, the winning Vee team turned and stared at the wall of five criminals. The father of the Vee team motioned a hand with a smile to the family unit. They gathered in a huddle in front of the soft bench. The father dropped and slammed a hand over the soft fabric. The bench lip lifted up in silence and revealed an array of deadly weapons that were neatly tucked down into the bed of the cabinet. The father leaned down and selected a weapon for his wife and each child. Then, each member of the Vee team spun around, moved ahead and stopped, turning with a sneer and standing in front of a criminal that was located on the wall.

The first member of the Vee Team, the father stopped and stood in front of the first oval shaped on the wall of criminals that was wrapped in the colors of tan and red. He lifted and aimed one of four pick axes at the skull of first object on the forward wall.

On the wall of criminals, each object on the wall wiggled side to side, sounding in low, deep moans like a ghost.

Jackie stopped the twirl to see the wall of criminals with a smile and nod. "There are a set of five objects on the forward wall. That is perfect. Each Vee team member has a weapon and is standing in front of one object. Thus, each Vee team member will hit the object until the red tape turns into the color of black. This justification case cannot be completed until all the objects have turned into the color of rich black. And the team member will start with the largest object on the forward wall. Regulators are not required to assist any of the Vee team. Let's hustle without the music to the door, Jamie." She whirled in a circle with a smile and moved toward the side of the wall with the open archway.

"I'm hustling without the music to the door, Jackie." Jamie swirled in a circle with a smile and a nod, scooting toward the open door on the opposite side of the wall.

Jackie and Jaime swung around and stood inside the archway for safety with a smile and a nod in unison. "Aim high..."

Both doors slid down and closed.

The first member of the Vee team, the father released the first pick axe. The weapon flew through the air with a soft whistle.

On the tan colored wall, the first object on the wall of criminals was hit inside the chest cavity and screamed with a pain. "Ah..."

The father of the Vee team reached down, grabbing a second pick axe, reaching back and tossed the weapon at the skull of the first oval object. The pick axe twirled and glittered over and over underneath the artificial lights and hit the red color tape at skull of the male.

"Gah..." The voice of the male, the first object on the wall of criminals continued to groan with pain as the tan colored body jerked side to side in pain and then stilled in silence death.

The first member of the Vee Team, the father lowered the throwing arm and dropped down the other pick axes onto the soft fabric of the bench and turned with a snigger and an evil smile to see the second Vee team, his middle aged wife.

The second Vee team member, a middle aged female wore a set of two cheekbones of yellow and black colored bumblebees, holding a long spear with a plain hilt in one hand. She stood with a pair of red colored jeweled sandals apart inside the ankle-length matching sparkling gown, gritting the teeth and posed the spear above a collar bone, flinging a tossing arm forward and released the spear. The weapon flew straight and steady over the tan colored floor and through the air waves, stabbing into the chest cavity at the heart organ.

"Iyhiih..." The voice of the female, the second object on the wall of criminals screamed in searing pain. The tan colored taped limbs jerked upright and fell down toward the floor as the red tape turned into black death.

The second member of the Vee team, the middle aged female turned with a smile and a nod to the third member of the Vee team, her elderly mother.

The third Cee team member, the elderly grandmother wore a single yellow colored bumblebee on a forehead, lifting from the bench and into the air, aiming a one of four sharp steak knives at the third object on the wall of criminals.

The third object on the wall of criminals was a short oval shaped object which appeared like a teenager.

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal within Society City Three, he gasped with a grin down at the com-d. "Hmm, I do believe that is a new weapon within Zulu Time. The Regulators are always updating the armory for swift and silence pain. I wonder if the old woman can toss the steak knife that far. But, it is a better weapon for her fragile and feeble hands than a sword or a spear. I wished Igala was here with me. She's missing a great show of Zulu Time, tonight."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the elderly grandmother tossed each steak knife continuously at the third object on the wall of criminals. Each steak knife hit the center of the rib cage, the chest cavity, and the stomach, and the right leg.

"Pfft..." The voice of the teenage male, the third object on the wall of criminals softly moaned in pain as the red colored tape turned into black rich hues of color and then he breathed a last breath of life, going straight into silent death.

The third member of the Vee team, the elderly grandmother turned with a sneer and a nod to the fourth member of the Vee team, her husband, the elderly grandfather.

The fourth Vee team member, the elderly grandfather wore a set of black colored bumblebees over each cheekbone, grabbing and lifting with a stern face, aiming a tiny electric crossbow at the fourth objecto on the wall of criminals.

The fourth object on the wall of criminals was a shorter oval shaped object which appeared like a pre-teenager.

The fourth Vee team member, the elderly grandfather fired continuously an array of short and sharp pointy arrow tips into the skull, the center of the rib cage, the stomach, and the right arm.

"Uoo..." The voice of the female pre-teenage, the fourth object on the wall of criminals briefly screamed in a sound of high-pitched pain. The red colored tape on the skull turned into rich black that was followed by the black coloring of the rib cage, the stomach, and the right arm.

The fourth member of the Vee team, the elderly grandfather released the trigger of the electric cross bow, lowering an arm and dropped the weapon down onto the soft fabric of the bench, turning with a smile and a nod to see the fifth member of the Vee team, his adult daughter. The adult daughter lived with the husband and the wife inside the house, also.

The fifth Vee team member, a middle aged female wore a set of yellow and black colored bumblebees on her neck, grabbing and lifted, rearing back one of three hammers at fifth object on the wall of criminals.

The fifth object on the wall of criminals was the smallest of the oval shape which appeared like a pre-teenager, also.

The fifth Vee team member tossed the hammer with a growl. The hammer twirled around and around and hit the wall, not the wiggling object. She exhaled with a puff of annoyance. She reached down and grabbed, lifting a second hammer and reared back a cupped hand, tossing the weapon at the skull of the fifth smallest object of the wall of criminals. The second hammer flew through the air waves and hit the side of the skull of the criminal, without death.

"Eek..." The pre-teenager male, the fifth object on the wall of criminals softly squeaked in pain as his four limbs of arms and legs lifted up and down, slamming into the back wall. The red colored tape did not turn to rich black hues.

The fifth Vee team member, the sister of the wife reached down and grabbed, lifting and released the third hammer, sailing the weapon through the air waves and over the floor, hitting into the red colored tape of the skull of the fifth object on the wall of criminals.

"Uoo..." The voice of the pre-teen male, the fifth object on the wall of criminals briefly screamed in pain. Then red colored tape on the skull turned into rich black hue and then into stillness of dead.

The fifth Vee team member, the adult sister turned with a snigger and a nod to see the family members.

The room went dark.

Jackie and Jamie within the darkness said in unison. "It is done. I hoped that you have enjoyed the evening program, so far. The night is still young and fresh. Sit back and stay tuned for more Zulu Time!"

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Three, he smiled down at the com-d. "Wow! There's more Zulu Time. "The tiny screen on the com-d showed a set of orange and blue wiggling lines with a song of soft piano music for a few minutes.

Society City Four

08:08 pm (early evening)

Zulu Time room in tan color

Warm temperatures and night sky of light rain

The screen wiggled sideways and showed a set of two open archways on curved wall.

A pale skinned female exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female exited from the second side door as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jackie and Jamie Jones."

Jackie slowly twirled around in a tight circle in the same dress and facial designs with a smile and a nod to see each glass screen. "I am Jackie. Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice. We will explain the rules for any new audience attendees. When an injustice has occurred, each party is presented here at the Zulu Time building."

Jamie slowly swirled around in tight circle the same dress and facial designs with a smile and a nod to see each glass screen. "I am Jamie. Then each party is allowed to voice their justification case within a twenty second deadline in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your suppertime meal. After the twenty seconds has ended, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for criminal or the letter of V for victim."

Each female spun around with a smile and moved back to a closed door.

The Cee team door opened first.

Jamie swung around with a smile from the open archway, leading a line of five people in front of a low and long bench of soft beige fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of mumbles and grunts, turning and pointing to each tiny television plasma screen on the curved wall, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of orange color. Each face was decorated with a solid dark green colored line that showed the Roman numeral sequences of four people.

The Vee team door opened next.

Jackie spun around with a smile from the second open archway on the opposite wall, leading a line of three people in front of the same long bench of soft fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind the back spine of Jackie and scanned the room and the opposing party with a set of sneers and finger pointing on the other side of the room. Each person wore a formal gown or tuxedo in the color of lavender with a set of hollow outlines of red and blue trains on various body parts, such like, foreheads, cheeks, and forearms.

Jamie and Jackie swung around and met in middle of the room with a smile and a nod, twirling in a tight circle with a hand wave to see each glass screen.

Jackie stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of pretty lavender. My twin sister Jamie stands behind the Cee team. The Vee team claims that little mean-spirited four-year-old girl of the Cee team stole the red and blue choo-choo train of their son at the fun play center on the same neighbor street. The mean and rude family of the Cee team will not hand back the child's toy back to the little their four-year-old son. So, this family unit demands just and justice. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team."

Inside the private suit of Ucal within Society City Three on top of the bed mattress, he laughed and stared down at the tiny screen of the com-d. "If you have had beaten the heck out of the little girl, your problem would have been solved, dude. Then you won't be inside Zulu Time, now. Woe, some family unit is going to be so sorry and so dead." He laughed.

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jamie stopped the twirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Cee team in the color of vivid orange. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty-second time period. Since, each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jackie turned with a smile and handed the microphone to the female of the Vee team in the first position of the column. Her sister Jamie turned and handed her microphone to the male of the Cee team in the first position of the column. Both twins back stepped from the bench and two debating teams, standing inside the empty space on the wall, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The adult middle-aged mother of the Vee team wore a plantation gown of lavender with a black Roman numeral of one on the cheekbone and a pair of matching long elbow length gloves, lifting the microphone with a sad face. "I am here inside Zulu Time. I am kindly asking for the tiny red and blue train back to my little son. It is his favorite fun toy. Please, give the train back to him."

The adult middle-aged female of the Cee team wore an ankle-length gown of orange, a pair of matching elbow gloves, and a red and blue facial train outline near a sneer, jabbing the other finger at each family member. "Chicken, chicken, chicken..."

The other family members of the Cee team joined the shout and jabbed a finger at each face of the Vee team in unison, repeating the nasty slur. "Chicken, chicken, chicken..."

The adult middle-aged female of the Cee team changed the word. "Stupid, stupid, stupid..."

The other family members of the Cee team changed the chant, shouting and jabbed a finger at each face of the Vee team in unison, repeating the nasty slur. "Stupid, stupid, stupid..."

The adult middle-aged female of the Cee team changed the word. "Dumb, dumb, dumb..."

The other family members of the Cee team changed the chant, shouting and jabbed a finger at each face of the Vee team in unison, repeating the nasty slur. "Dumb, dumb, dumb..."

The mother of the Vee team dropped a mouth and tried to speak inside her microphone a single word, except the loud chanting would not stop.

The adult middle-aged female of the Cee team changed the word. "Dead, dead, dead..."

The other family members of the Cee team changed the chant, shouting and jabbed a finger at each face of the Vee team in unison, repeating the nasty slur. "Dead, dead, dead..."

The room went black as the voices faded into silence.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The twenty second deadline has expired."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only."

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness. "If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl."

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Three, he smiled down at the com-d. "I know who I am voting for. The kid is a baby. And the mother of the kid is a wussie lady." He pressed the button on the tiny screen on the com-d for the Vee team with a smile and an evil laugh.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The voting is finished. Please illuminate all the glass screens now inside Zulu Time."

All the tiny glass screens showed a black back ground with one single letter in white.

The voice of Jamie gasped within the darkness at each illuminated screen. "O might, Jackie!"

The voice of Jackie gasped within the darkness at each illuminated screen also. "O might goodness, Jamie!"

The voices of Jackie and Jamie said within the darkness in unison, "The highest mathematical number wins the justification case inside the Zulu Time room which is the letter C for the criminal team."

The tiny lights of each glass screen went black.

The dark room echoed in a series of loud screams and harsh curses plus the sounds of soft rips and loud tears of fabric. Then, the room was silent.

A few second later, the lights illuminated inside the room.

On the forward wall, there were four objects. They stood in height from the tallest down to the shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages, coming from the hair roots down to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

The winning Cee team turned and grouped in front of the long bench in whispers and pointed at the four objects on the wall of criminals.

Jackie twirled around in a tight circle to see each screen with a smile. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, each Cee team member must participate and accept the judgment. Thus, the Vee team has lost the justification case. Now, each Vee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of beige and the pretty color of red against the forward wall for justice. Each Vee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment too. Thus, the Cee team is sentenced to death by means of the Cee team's fun and creative methods on the wall of criminals."

Jamie swirled around in a tight circle to see each glass screen with a smile. "Cee team, please select your pleasure. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. Pick out whatever suites your heart and your hand. This part of Zulu Time is choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Cee team member must fire one weapon at one oval shaped object and kill the wiggling object on the forward wall. A Cee team member will know a kill shot has occurred when the oval shaped object has turned into the color of rich black, covering the tan or red tape. And I do believe that our evening audience is filled with a set of parents that feel hate and non-protection for other children which is symbolized with the Cee team win for tonight."

Jackie stopped the swirl and smiled at wall of criminals. "There are too few objects on the forward wall. That is not a prob, thou. Each Vee team member has a paired up and holds a weapon, standing in front of one object. Thus, each Vee team member will hit the object until the red tape turns into the color of black with a kill shot. However, the last Vee team member is a tiny little boy of four years old."

Jamie stopped the twirl and smiled at the wall of criminals. "The rules of Zulu Time state that a child as young as four years old must aim and fire a weapon. This justification case cannot be completed until all the objects have turned black for death. And the first team member will start with the largest object on the forward wall. No single Regulator is required to assist any member of the Cee team. Let's get outta of here, now, Jackie."

"I'm outta of here, now, Jamie." Jackie said with a smile and a nod.

Each Zulu Time hostess spun around and dashed to the opposite side of the wall into a dark archway.

The first member of the Cee team, the middle aged woman leaned down and tapped the top of the soft fabric with a snigger. The lid lifted up and revealed an array of unused weapons. The used weapons were not replaced back into the cabinet for utilization. She tapped the soft fabric. The soft lid dropped down in silence.

Each Cee member turned to the side and moved ahead in different directions with a parental assistant, turning and stood in front of one of six objects that lined the wall of criminals.

Jackie and Jaime swung around and stood inside the archway for safety with a smile and a nod in unison. "Aim high..."

Both the doors closed down and shut.

The first Cee team member, the middle aged mother with a red and blue outline of a train on the cheekbone reached down, grabbing and lifted one of three long swords into a fighting hand with a smile, rearing it back and fired the steel blade at the heart of the first object on the wall of criminals.

"Argh..." The voice of the middle aged female, the first and largest object on the wall of criminals briefed screamed with pain as the tan colored body jerked up, down, and sideways, coming from the direct penetration of the sword into the right leg.

The first Cee team member, the middle aged mother exhaled with a puff of annoyance and reached down, grabbing and lifting the second sword. She reared back and aimed at the chest cavity of the heart, releasing the weapon at the first object on the wall of criminals. The steel tip of the sharp blade soared through the air waves and hit, stabbing into the red colored tape which was the heart organ.

The red colored taped turned into rich color of black and as, the first object on the wall of criminals, middle aged female wiggled side to side and stilled in death with a grunt.

The first Cee team member, the middle aged mother turned with a smile and a nod to see the second member of the Cee team, her husband.

The second Cee team member, her husband, the mature male wore a set of red and blue train outlines on each cheekbone stood in front of the second object on the wall of criminals and grabbed, lifting and held a single ball. The ball was studded with a series of sharp points that cut into a pair of heavy gloves over both hands of the father. He tossed the first spiked ball at the skull of the second object on the wall of criminals. The ball flew over the floor and through the air waves, hitting the left arm of the second object on the wall of criminals.

"Waah," the voice of the teen female, the second object on the wall of criminals sounded in pain and as, his four limbs jumped up, down, and sideways, hitting the back wall of tan cloth. The left arm turned red onto the tan colored tape without death.

The second Cee team member, the father exhaled with a puff of frustration and reached down, grabbed, lifting and aimed a second spiked ball at the skull of the second object on the wall of criminals. He released the ball. The second ball flew high up into an arch and came down toward the floor, landing on top of the red colored tape which was the skull region on second object on the wall of criminals.

"Pfft..." the voice of the teen female softly moaned in pain and as, the all the red colored tape turned into rich black hue. Then she breathed a last breath into death.

The second Cee team member, the middle aged father turned with a nod and a smile to the third member of the Cee team, his mother and the grandmother of the children.

The third Cee team member, the elderly grandmother wore a red and blue train on one cheekbone in an orange and stood front of the third, fourth, and fifth objects on the wall of criminals. Her two little granddaughters, who were ages of five and four years old, stood behind the queen-sized woman with a worried brow, wringing the gloved hands, wearing a tiny orange gown with a pair of matching gloves with a red and blue train on each cheekbone.

The last and smallest object on the wall of criminals moaned like a ghost throughout the airways and wiggled side to side inside the tight wrapping of the tan and red colored tape over the entire body, coming from the hair roots down to the toenails.

Each little girl reached up and slapped both hands over the eardrums with a set of tear, hearing the soft scary sounds throughout the quiet room.

The Zulu Time room held no music, no chair, no friends, only the wall of criminals and the line of his family members. Each family member of the Cee team turned and stood in silence, watching the grandmother.

The grandmother lifted and aimed a manual cross bow with a pointy arrow at the third and smallest object on the wall of criminals, releasing the string. The arrow sung through the air waves and stabbed into the left eyeball of the red colored tape within the skull space of the third object on the wall of criminals.

"Eek..." the voice of the five-year-old male child, the third and smallest object on the awl of criminals softly squeaked in pain and as, his four limbs of arms and legs lifted up and down, slamming down into the wall in stillness and silence. The red colored tape turned into rich black, announcing the final death.

The grandmother leaned down and dropped the bow and arrow weapon on top of the soft fabric of the short long bench, reaching out and grabbed one of the selected screwdrivers as the next weapon of death. She spun around and grabbed the collar bone of her two granddaughters, shoving each child to stand in front of the bench and planted a screwdriver into a tiny hand. Each little girl accepted and wrapped a gloved fist around the lightweight object.

Inside the private suit of Ucal within Society City Three, he nodded with a stern face. "Yeah, that's really smart, Granny. The child has to hit the tan colored object on the wall of criminals, even though the child is clearly dead. It is a good idea with the lightweight weapon of a simply screwdriver tool. The child can easier toss that object at the dead body on the wall. Citizens didn't know that the wall of criminals is about fifty feet or so away. The child should aim the screwdriver up and then let it arch and fall down with gravity onto the tan colored tape."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the grandmother leaned down with a smile and a whisper into the eardrum of the five-year-old child first, back stepping from the back spine of the child.

The five-year-old female nodded in silence and lifted, rearing back the screwdriver, tossing it through the air, hitting it on the side part of the tan colored leg of the child which qualified as a kill shot on the third object on the forward wall as a member of Cee team. The child started to bounce up and down. The grandmother moved ahead and firmly slapped both hands over the collar bone of the child, leaning down with a stern face and a whisper into the eardrum of the child, again. The child frowned and stopped celebrating with a victory dance, standing in place in silence.

The grandmother shuffled sideways and stood behind the four-year-old female, who was the nasty criminal for taking the red and blue toy train from the little boy. The girl wore an orange gown with a pair of matching gloves and a red and blue train on one cheekbone. The grandmother leaned down with a stern face and a whisper into the eardrum of the little girl. The four-year-old girl nodded in silence and wiped off the tears. The grandmother stood upright and backed away from the child.

The four-year-old girl lifted the screwdriver near a shoulder and tossed the weapon at the center of the smallest oval on the wall of criminals. The screwdriver sailed up high and then arched back down with gravity, landing and hit the top of the skull, bouncing off and rested on top of the soft tan colored material on the floor without a kill shot. The little girl had completed the task with a set of sobs and tears.

The grandmother advanced ahead and leaned down, hugging her granddaughters.

The Zulu Time room went black.

The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "It is done."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "I hoped that you have enjoyed the evening program, so far."

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness. "The night is still young and fresh. Sit back and stay tuned for more Zulu Time."

Each wall of glass inside every home within Society City Four changed into a set of wiggling lines of pink and purple.

Inside the bedroom suite of Ucal on top of the mattress within Society City Three, he frowned down at the com-d. "You died over a silly toy when the mother and the child should have forgotten and forgiven, which is a one of those golden rules of life. Geez, this is the wrong reason for being invited into Zulu Time, six dumb and dead bodies." The screen on the com-d continued to play a country song with a set of banjos and fiddles and a set of wiggling lines of pink and purple.

Society City Four

09:09 pm (mid-evening)

Zulu Time room of tan hue

Then, the music ceased.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness said in unison, "Welcome to Zulu Time, the place for just and justice."

Then, the face of each girl appeared on the wall of glass within each home within Society City Four and on the single com-d of Ucal. A new song of trumpet and piano jazzy music and an array of colorful fireworks flamed over both the collar bones of both Jackie and Jaime within the back ground.

The Zulu Time room was fashioned into a D-shape with one continuous wall and a straight rear back wall. The curved wall was colored in tan, without a single art painting or a viewing window of the trees and the sunlight. The forward wall was long and straight, holding emptiness

The single door on the side wall slid upward and opened.

Jackie strolled and exited from one of two side doors. Then Jaime strolled and exited from the second side door. Both the females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated in a series of tight circles, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jaime and Jackie Jones."

Jackie wore the same dress and the facial designs, twirling around in the same spot with a smile, holding the microphone, seeing each tiny glass screen. "Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of just and justice."

Jaime wore the same dress and the facial designs, spinning around in the same spot with a smile, holding the microphone to see all the tiny glass screens on the curved wall. "I am Jaime. I will explain all the rules for any new audience viewers. Each party is allowed to voice their justification case within a twenty-second time period in front of you and your wall of glass while you rest and eat your suppertime meal. After twenty seconds has ended, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for the criminal or the letter of V for the victim."

Then, each female spun around with a smile and moved back to a closed door on the opposite wall.

The Cee team door opened first.

Jaime swung around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of four people in front of a low and long bench of soft fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of sneers, finger pointing on each tiny glass screen, wearing the same long evening gowns and tuxedos in the color of yellow. Each face was decorated with a set of solid colored dots.

A second door opened on the opposite wall.

Jackie spun around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of four people in front of the same bench of soft beige fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and turned with a sigh of worry, scanning the rear wall, where all criminals would be posted and killed by the firepower of the winning team of Zulu Time. The Vee team members wore a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of rose colored. Each face was decorated in a set multiple colored figure eight symbols.

Jamie and Jackie spun around and met in middle with a smile, twirling with a hand wave to see each glass screen.

Jackie stopped the swirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, standing in place, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of soft rose. My twin sister Jamie stands behind to Cee team. The Vee team claims that the six-year-old child of the Cee team stole and ate a piece of peppermint chocolate covered candy that belonged to the five-year-old girl of the Vee team which occurred inside a grassy park playground setting, last week. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team."

Inside the bedroom suite of Ucal on top of the mattress within Society City Three, he gasped in shock. "Geez, all of you are doing to die over a piece of chocolate covered candy. Geez, you are so stupid. Actually, you are really greedy here. Since, the adults of the family unit desire all the nice assets of the Cee team. Dum, dum, dum, dead," laughing.

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jamie stopped the twirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone. "I am Jaime. I stand behind the Cee team of bright yellow. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty seconds of time. Since, each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jackie handed the microphone to the middle aged adult male of the Vee team with a smile. Jamie extended an arm and handed her microphone to a middle aged male of the Cee team. They both back stepped from the bench and the two debating teams, sliding into an empty space on the wall and said in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The middle aged man of the Vee team wore a rose tinted tuxedo with a pair of golden colored gloves and a matching bowtie and a face of multiple colored figure eights, accepting the microphone, standing in silence without speaking.

The middle aged father of the Cee team accepted the microphone and lifted up into the lips with a sad face, wearing a yellow colored tuxedo and a pair of black colored gloves with a matching bowtie of black. "I feel so sorry for your family unit. You brought my precious family unit into Zulu Time as a set of criminals over a piece of stale candy that my son found on the grassy soil inside the playground park. I am not blind here. My family unit owns a big and beautiful house, a set of new hover cars, and tons of re-gen furniture that you will never get to touch with a set of dirty and greasy finger pads. It is hard to own material possession down inside hell, my newest non-friend."

Each member of the Vee team turned with a sad face and a set of sobs and tears to see the forward wall in silence.

The room remained silence. The seconds clicked away and down from twenty to zero seconds.

Inside the bedroom suite of Ucal on top of the mattress within Society City Two, he nodded with a sneer. "Yeah, an entire family is going to die and descend down into hell."

Inside the Zulu Time building, the Zulu Time room went dark.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie sneered within the darkness with a soft unison. "The deadline of twenty seconds has expired."

The voice of Jackie sneered within the darkness "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only."

The voice of Jaime sneered within the darkness. "If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl."

Inside the bedroom suite of Ucal on top of the mattress within Society City Two, he pressed the button with a sneer on the com-d screen. "Yeah, the Vee team is going to die and descend down into hell. Greed and greedy is a sin, evil people."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the voices of Jackie and Jaime within the darkness stared at each black tinted screen. "The voting is finished. Please illuminate all the glass screens now inside Zulu Time."

All the tiny glass screens showed a black back ground with one single letter in white.

The voice of Jamie sneered within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "I am not surprised, Jackie."

The voice of Jackie sneered within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "I am not, either, Jamie."

The voices of Jamie and Jackie sneered without the darkness. "The highest mathematical number wins the justification case. The highest number of letter is C for the criminal team."

The tiny lights from the millions of six inches by six inches of glass screens darkened.

The dark room echoed in a series of loud screams and harsh curses plus the sounds of soft rips and tears of fabric. Then, the room was silent.

A few minutes later, all the lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room.

On the forward wall, there were four objects. They stood in height from the tallest down to the shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages, coming from the hair roots down to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

In front of the continuous long and low sitting bench of soft fabric colored that was mounted from wall-to-wall, the Cee team stood in a tight huddle with a series of whispered mumbles and turned, finger pointing at each wiggling oval shaped object on the forward wall.

Jackie stood in place without a smile. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, each Cee team member must participate and accept the judgment. Thus, the Vee team has lost the justification case. Now, each Vee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of beige and the color of red against the rear wall for justice. Each Vee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment, too. Thus, the Vee team is sentenced to death by means of the Cee team on the wall of criminals."

Jamie stood in place with a stern face at the wall of criminals. "Cee team, please select the weapon. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. Pick out whatever. This part of Zulu Time is choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Cee team member must fire one weapon at one oval shaped object and kill the wiggling object on the forward wall. A Cee team member will know a kill shot has occurred when the oval shaped object has turned into the color of rich black, covering the tan or red tape. And I do believe that our evening audience is filled with awe of pity for the Vee team members as a greedy family unit."

The four Cee team members continued to huddle together with whispers, pointing down at the soft bench where an array of hidden weapons was located inside the sitting bench. The mother of the Cee team reached down and slapped the soft fabric. The lid opened. She bent down over the open cabinet and grabbed a weapon for each one of her family member and then shoved the family member toward on an object of tan and red colored tape on the wall of criminals.

Jamie back stepped with her sister and away the back spines of Cee team members, saying with a stern face. "There are four members of the Vee team and four members of Cee team. So, each member of Vee team is standing in front of an object on the forward wall, holding a weapon in both hands."

Jackie said with a stern face. "We need to leave the Zulu Time room, Jamie. The Regulators are not required within this Zulu Time activity."

Then, each female spun around without a smile and dashed toward an open archway on curved wall.

Both Jackie and Jaime swung around and stood inside a separate archway and out of the way, saying in unison with a stern face. "Aim high." They back stepped and moved into the dark tunnel for safety and protection.

Then both the doors closed shut and tight.

The first member of the Cee team, a teenage daughter wore an ankle-length gown of yellow and a pair of matching elbow gloves and stood in front of the largest object on the wall of criminals, holding a set of daggers within both gloves. She dropped the daggers over the soft fabric, lifting the first one, aiming at the red tape region which was the skull space and released the weapon. The weapon flew across the room and hit into the neck space of the tan tape on the first object on the wall of criminals.

"Aw..." The voice of the adult male, the first object on the wall of criminals cried out with pain and as, the tan colored body jerked side to side from the weapon impact onto the rear wall, without death.

The first member of the Cee team, the teen daughter reached down and grabbed a second weapon with a disappointed sigh, lifting it up over a collar bone, rearing back an arm and pitched a second bejeweled dagger at the largest object on the wall of criminals with a sneer.

"Uoo..." The voice of the male, the first objecto on the wall of criminals screamed out in pain and as, the red colored tape stayed red hues from the dagger stab into the chest cavity. The largest object wiggled side to side and moaned like a ghost without dying.

The first member of the Cee team, the teen daughter exhaled with a puff of disappointment again and reached down, grabbing a third jeweled dagger, lifting it up onto a collar bone and pitched the weapon at the red colored tape on the chest cavity for a second time. The dagger sailed through the air and stabbed into the first weapon, sticking and shoving both daggers into the heart organ.

"Ooo..." A voice of the male, the first and largest object on the wall of criminals screamed in pain inside the empty room and as, the red colored tape on the chest cavity turned into rich black hue. The largest oval object on the wall of criminals wiggled side to side and then stilled within death.

The first member of the Cee team, the teen daughter turned with a smile and a nod to see the second member of the Cee team, her father.

The second Cee team member, the father nodded with a stern face to his daughter and looked down, grabbing one of the poles that contained a medium sized spiked ball. He lifted the weapon over the hair roots, swinging it around within the air waves and released the handle pole. The spiked ball led through the air and slammed into the red colored tape which was face space of the second object on the wall for criminals.

The second objecto on the wall of criminals, the middle aged female exhaled with a last breath. "Pfft..."

The second member of the Cee team, the father turned with a stern face and a nod to third member of the Cee team, his wife.

The third member of the Cee team, the middle aged female nodded with a stern face to her husband, and turned to see the third object on the wall of criminals.

The third object on the wall of criminals looked like a teenager.

The third member of the Cee team, the middle aged female stood in place with a pair of jeweled sandals apart inside the ankle-length yellow, gritting the teeth and tossed a nasty-looking curved sword at the red colored tape which was the skull space of the third object on the wall of criminals.

The tip of the curved blade hit the left eye socket of the red colored tape of the third object on the wall of criminals. Then blade tip twisted to the side, dropping down and stuck onto the chest cavity of the red colored tape and as, the red colored tape turned rich black quickly without a scream or a puff of death from the third object on the wall of criminals.

The third member of the Cee team, the middle aged female turned with a stern face and a nod to see the fourth member of the Cee team, her son.

The fourth Cee team member, the five-year-old little boy exhaled with a puff of worry and fear at the fourth and smallest object on the wall of criminals, wearing a yellow colored tuxedo and a pair of black gloves with a matching bowtie. He reached down and grabbed a throwing star at the smallest oval shaped object on the wall of criminals.

The individual star weapon hit the taped leg of the last and third object on the wall of criminals, the five-year-old female child screamed in pain. The tan colored tape turned into red colored blood, "Aahh..."

Inside the private suit of Ucal within Society City Three, he frowned down at the com-d screen. "It is another new weapon from the Regulators, a set of throwing stars. A great death weapon. However, each spinning star is made of very heavy steel. It takes strength and speed to hit an object. I hope the little boy can do it."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the little boy shook a skull and leaned down, grabbing a second throwing star, lifting up and reared back with the sharp weapon, releasing it. The throwing star sail through the air and stuck into the tan colored tape which was the other leg of the fourth object on the wall of criminals.

The fourth object on the wall of criminals, the little girl yelled in pain, wiggling all the tan colored wrapped limbs side to side with a second red colored leg of her blood, "Waah..."

The fourth Cee team member, the little boy shook a skull and leaned down, grabbing a third throwing star, lifting up and reared back with the sharp weapon, releasing it. The throwing star sail through the air and stuck into the tan colored tape which was the kneecap space of the fourth and last object on the wall of criminals.

The fourth object on the wall of criminals, the five-year-old girl inside the tan and red tape screamed in pain and wiggled side to side with a yell, "Iyhiih..."

The fourth Cee member, the little boy shook a skull and leaned down, grabbing a fourth and a fifth throwing star in each hand, lifting up and reared back with the sharp weapons releasing both of them.

One star hit the wall. The other star hit the eleventh rib of her rib cage. "Ooo..." The tiny voice of the little girl, the last object on the wall of criminals screamed in pain into the empty room and as, the tan colored turned red colored with her blood.

The fourth Cee team member, the boy shook a skull and leaned down, grabbing a sixth and a seventh throwing star in each hand, lifting up and reared back with the sharp weapons releasing both of them.

"Aww..." A fourth object on the wall of criminals, the little girl screamed in horror and as, the tan colored tape on chest cavity turned bright red only.

The fourth Cee team member, the little boy continued to lift up and flung a series of four more throwing stars at the smallest and last object on the wall of criminals.

"Ahh...." The fourth object on the wall of the criminals, the five-year-old girl yelled and cried in pain, flinging a wounded right leg side to side along with the other leg. However, the star was stuck through the bone and the skin. The next throwing star struck and stuck into the red colored tape which was the cheekbone of the child. "Eeyah..." The little girl screamed and cried in pain, flinging one tan colored tape of the uninjured arm up and down, hitting the rear wall. The next throwing star hit and stabbed the rear wall. The last throwing star struck and stabbed into her neck. "Pfft..." The fourth object on the wall of criminals, the five-year-old little girl exhausted with a last breath and as, the smallest and last oval shaped object was covered in red colored of blood and finally rich black hues over the neck space.

The room went dark.

The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "It is done."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "Thank you for visiting Zulu Time. I hoped that you have enjoyed the evening program."

The voice of Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "Good night from Jaime and Jackie Jones until tomorrow night."

Then, the room went black.

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the mattress within Society City Three, he leaned over and rested the com-d on top of the nightstand without a smile. "Good night, Igala! I promise we will have fun together, tomorrow night." He flipped over and rested a chin over the soft pillow, not sleeping with a deep sigh and a low grunt "...without Dfee, too..."

285th day of the current year

Society City Three

10:10 am (late morning)

Warm temperatures and bright sun

Private suite of Igala

Entrance door setting

**T** he sound of a hand knock echoed throughout the suite.

I rushed forward from the bedroom toward the closed door with a smile and stopped, lifting the collector bar into a face. "Wow, this is so nice. The Regulators have deposit a ton of coins into the collector bar. Geez, I might never have to work a re-gen job. Then, I could marry Dfee and be a housewife. I wondered if the role of housewife existed within Society City Four." I lifted the dress with a grin over both collar bones and a face, replacing the collector bar of earned coin back down into the tiny pouch on the right side of the dress and dropped the gown over my legs and the floor, standing upright. I reached over and slammed the metal with a hand and a giggle of a smile.

The door opened and revealed the teen male.

I stood in place and wore an ankle-length gown of rich black colors with a ton of shiny zillions of tiny sequins. The necklace was V-shaped traveling down between the two breasts and stopped a little above the belly button. The back spine was exposed from the halter type style.

Ucal gasped with a grin. "Good morn, Igala! Wow, you look so gorgeous in your new gown."

I giggled with teenly hormones, hearing his tender words of charm. "I feel pretty."

He extended an arm to her with a smile. I grabbed the arm, moving ahead toward the hallway elevators, feeling the dress hem drag behind my butthole. I reached down and gathered a handful of the dress and jerked it forward. The dress obeyed as I giggled.

They turned to the staircase and slowly advanced down each step carefully.

I moved down the steps and smiled down at the empty white colored lobby of the building. "What Society City are we visiting next, this morning?"

He moved the steps and cuddled her with a smile. "Society City Two, it will be a nice surprise for the both of us."

I frowned down at the lobby scene. "You keep telling both of our personal Zulu Time tales. So, what is it for me left to do inside the rest of the Society Cities?"

He nodded with a smile and stared ahead at the parked limousine. The transport stood on the dirt outside the hotel building. He smiled. "The human side, it is left to reveal. The citizens need an understanding of the full impact of Zulu Time from the other side, not seeing only a black screen of a com-d. At first, the screens were clear colored and built for weird weather patterns of ice, rain, and storms to protect the attendees. No one cared about the Zulu Time teams."

"The fittest team survives..."

He led through the open archway and stopped with a smile.

Limousine airship ride of Igala and Ucal

Western direction

Warm temperatures with dull sunrays

I slid down through the open door and scooted toward the far window with a smile.

He slid inside the bench seating and sat next to her gown with a smile and a chuckle. "Something like that! Then when the clear panels were covered in so much blood, it was decided to build them in the color of black tint. There were plasmas inside the stadium for visual viewing. Then when the com-d was invented everyone carried the communication device inside a back pocket of a skirt or trousers. So, Zulu Time eliminated the plasma screens inside the stadium allowing folks to ping into the satellite network. A citizen could see Zulu Time any time of day on a com-d."

The driver closed the door and turned, moving into the front seat, preparing the vehicle for flight.

I frowned. "But, Zulu Time starts at seven at night. Everyone sits and watches on the big wall of glass and votes on a com-d."

The limousine lifted up from the dirt and created a set of yellow looking balls of dust, flying forward toward the edge of Society City Three.

He exhaled. "The invention of the wall of glass as a monitor shows more of the action and blood rather than the tiny com-d. Within the earlier years, Zulu Time was all day and all night keeping the pits within the Bowl arena full of fighting teams. The citizens could watch twenty-four hours, all day and night. And sometimes, the next set of two opposing teams would fight on top of the dead bones and bodies, making for a true criminal element, violently vicious killing anyone and anything around the dead folks. The poor stupid Vee T-mates didn't have a chance against a real murderer. But the citizens desired and demanded more Zulu Time. So Zulu Time replaced the legal justice system, completely by the year 2061. Then the Regulator stopped folks from dancing over the skulls of the other dead people allowing the dead bodies all buried inside the tomb of white for salvation. I guess."

I frowned. "That's sick."

He nodded. "That's Zulu Time. Within the early years, Society was plagued with thugs, thieves, rapists, murderers which even included some groups of medical professional, who cheated Society or citizens out of coin or killed out the sicker patients for more coin. Zulu Time allowed each criminal and each victim equal share to survive. I believe Zulu Time started out good and now it has escalated into madness."

"So why are we touring for Zulu Time and visiting all the different Society Cities? I don't understand. And your knowledge of Zulu Time is both disturbing and delightful at the same time. Why can't folks, just read it on their com-d?"

He turned and stared with a sneer out the front windshield. "They don't want to read, learn, comprehend, and understand, just wanna watch it on the wall of glass with flying blood proteins and body parts. That led the Regulators to invent the sticky tape, where the blood proteins and the body parts did not hit the tiny glass screens within the Zulu Time room. I'm giving it the personal, human touch, sharing my personal emotions and feelings."

I looked down with a sad face to see my new re-designer dress. "I don't feel like sharing my story, Ucal. I'm having problems accepting what I did. I killed an innocent person inside Zulu Time over myself. I don't know if I can voice my true feelings. They're so raw and emotional and confused and sadness and happiness."

He turned and nodded with a smile at her black colored hair roots. "I'm feeling the same way, gorgeous. I'm so glad you decided to accompany me on Tour of Zulu Time."

I looked up with a smile to see him. "I like the company and the cozy limo ride and my dress and my shoes," giggling.

He smiled. "After this, we can walk the sandy beach, feel the water, and talk about raw emotions. We will not attend any other single Zulu Time event here within another Society City. How's that sound, gorgeous?"

I smiled. "Lovely, me and you in the moonlight..."

"Yeah, me and you..." he leaned over with a smile and hugged her, pulling back with a wink and a grin. "Look, I'll do all the storytelling, again. I have lots of stuff to share and express. How about you nod or grunt or moan in the right spot?"

I nodded with a smile. "Yes, I can do that. I feel much better doing that. I really don't want them searching my soul." I felt the soft rumble of the powerful engines underneath the pair of spiked heel sandals without burning off my naked toes and as, my stomach swayed side to side with the air bumps within the sky.

The limousine accelerated up to one hundred miles per hour, soaring over the air waves and through the clouds.

I didn't bother to lean into the cool glass window. My peripheral vision could see the rows and rows of colored crop fields and the far distance of squat white buildings that represented the homes of each farmer family unit.

The limousine flew from the landscape, over the air space, and above the deep canyon.

Society City Four was shaped like an oval island and surrounded by a very deep canyon. The canyon went around and around Society City Four like a circle in every geographical direction.

I didn't bother to turn and press both hands onto the glass, feeling the cool air from the white clouds. The window slightly was bombarded with water droplets from the clouds, too. The white clouds had parted and revealed the landmass down inside the canyon which was way, way down there.

The limousine was crossing over the deep landscape of the mysterious Dead Man's Land.

I didn't bother to see the trees, the forests, the crops and the dried red mud houses again down inside the landscape. Dean Man's Land existed down there all alone and isolated from any of the other Society Cities. The only way down was inside a hover car, but the Regulator would not allow a pilot to do that.

The limousine reduced speed, slowed, and halted into a stop within the air waves, hovering in front of the twin steel gates at Dead Man's Land location among the orange fog with hot temperatures and bright sunrays.

Inside the rear bench, I didn't turn and gawk at the side window, staring into the front windshield. My eyeballs could see the row of standing Regulators in front of the twin steel gates.

The limousine floated within the air waves over Dead Man's Land which was located on the outer perimeter or outskirts of Society City Four. No one came out this far without being detected and monitored and then arrested by a Regulator.

The see-through wall of steel rods composed a set of two steel gates with a set of numerous hollow holes where the beams were crisscrossed within the gate pattern. You can see through the naked beam pattern with a pair of naked eyeballs. However, your person or a vehicle could not drive through the steel gates of beams unless you received permission from the row of Regulators.

The window of the driver dropped down. The Regulator stepped forward and leaned down, listening in silence to the driver of the air ship limousine and then nodded with a set of secret words back to the driver. The window rolled back up. The Regulator stepped back and nodded with a golden tinted skull to one of the Regulators.

The center Regulator held a palm sized device and pressed a button. Then, the entire row of Regulators parted and separated into two groups, sliding sideways from the center of the steel gate.

The two steel gates slowed parted and separated into two solid sections, opening the two separate gates in the outward direction and safely away from the row of Regulators and the grill of the limousine.

The two separate gates slowed and then halted in the air waves and above the landscape of Dead Man's Land.

The limousine slowed flew forward through the air waves between a set of empty space of the two twin gates.

The grill of limousine slowly emerged over the landscape of flat red dirt with a set of scattered tree groves inside Society City Four.

The view of the Dead Man's Land slowly disappeared from the side windows of the vehicle.

I did not bounce up and down with excitement with a second adventure trip with the Tour of Zulu Time, sitting back with a stern face at the forward windshield.

"Here we go, gorgeous." He sat back and cuddled next to Igala with a smile and a nod, staring at the front wind shield also.

The limousine increased speed and flew over the flat landscape of Society City Four, leaving the hometown of Igala and Ucal again to continue the Tour of Zulu Time.

Society City Four

Limousine airship ride of Igala and Ucal

Warm temperatures with bright sunshine

I scooted into the rear bench admiring the clean mats. I missed my little brother's science projects, my little sister's songs, my mom's kisses, and my dad's hugs. I agreed to the Tour of Zulu Time for my mom, not me. Her parents didn't crave the spotlight.

However, Zulu Time illuminated with glorious attention when you win the justification crime. Or a cold piece of marble, when you lost the justification crime.

I shivered to think that my family almost died within Zulu Time, resting inside the Cee Building of white marble for the rest of eternality.

I was close to my home and my feet hurt from the new pair of re-designer spiked heel sandals with a whisper for my eardrums only. "I wanna go back home, now."

The limousine sailed through the air waves without incident and reduced speed, slowed, and halted in the air waves for a second time in front of the southern side of the landmass which was the entrance portal into Society City Two.

Through each window view, there was a set of see-through wall of steel rods, making up two steel gates. Each steel gate contained a set of numerous hollow holes where the beams were crisscrossed within the gate pattern. A person could see through the naked beam pattern with a pair of naked eyeballs. However, the same person or the vehicle of the same person could not drive through the steel gates of beams unless the person received permission from the Regulators or death from the row of Regulators.

The window of the driver dropped down. The Regulator on the end of the row stepped forward and leaned down, listening in silence to the driver of the air ship limousine, nodding with a set of secret words back to the driver. The window rolled back up. The Regulator stepped back and nodded with a golden tinted skull, side steeping from the vehicle.

The center Regulator held a palm sized device and pressed a button. Then, the entire row of Regulators parted and separated into two groups, sliding sideways from the center of the steel gate.

The steel gates parted with a set of squealing noise.

I turned and leaned into the side window with a frown to see the Regulator and the part of the long steel gates. "There is that squealing noise, again."

"The steel gates are not used much, so they kinda squeal from the rust." Ucal nodded with a smile.

Each steel gate slowed parted and separated into a set of two solid sections, opening into a set of two separate gates in the outward direction and safely away from the row of Regulators and the grill of the limousine.

The two separate gates slowed and then halted in the air waves and above the land.

The limousine slowed flew forward through the air waves of the opened gates and above the view of Dead Man's Land.

My peripheral vision saw something different and as, my heart raced with excitement. I turned and pressed a nose profile and both hands, feeling the cool temperatures through the glass window with a gasp. "It's foggy. And the fog is slightly colored in orange tint. And the fog goes, as far as, my eyeballs can see. I see only fog. I've never seen an orange tinted fog or clouds or this."

"This is something." Ucal turned and smiled at his side window of the limousine, seeing only orange tinted clouds of the fog also.

I gasped through the window. "I can't anything with my eyeballs through the thick fog. What is Society City Two like?"

"You will see in a moment. The car has to fly through the thick fog. The fog is created from the hot temperature of Society City Two and the cool temperatures that drift and float up from the landscape of Dead Man's Land." Ucal turned to see her rear skull, enjoying her cute teenly behavior.

"Are we traveling through the air over the deep canyon, again? I can't tell. The fog is so thick here."

"Yes, Dead Man's Land is a natural phenomenon that is designed in an oval, if you will. The oval surrounds the Society City Four also."

"Why?"

"I don't really know why. It is a natural phenomenon like I said before. I guess our ancestors fell down inside Dead Man's Land and climbed up the wrong side of the cliff and then found and founded the landscape, naming it Society City Four." He smiled.

Society City Two

Colored sand grains. Blue ocean water

Hot temperatures with bright sunshine

The front grill of limousine slowly emerged from the orange tinted cloud, steering through the air waves into bright colored sunshine."

I bad breathed over the window with a gasp and a smile. "What is this place? It is so pretty and glittering like a set of gem stones."

He turned and slid, pressing a nose bridge into his side of the glass. His breathed fogged the window. "This is Society City Two, a sea city of sand and sun."

I gasped. "The buildings glitter and gleam in an array of individual different solid colors."

"The buildings are composed of sand. And the beach sand is composed of quartz. Quartz is a hard tiny rock of different colors. The sand quartz resists weathering processes, such as, wind, rain, and storms that could break down the tiny rocks into smaller grains that could collapse the buildings."

"Each building is a different color. I see an electric blue tone, a bright orange tint, a dull yellow color, a light green hue, and a dull red color. This place is so beautiful."

"Yeah, this is a tropical and coastal setting that is dominated by sand that blankets the beaches and the landscape as far as your naked eyeballs can see."

"Yeah, it is so beautiful..."

The limousine slowly flew over the landscape. Igala's window showed miles of flat colored sand grains that ended and started with miles of deep blue sea waters. The window view of Ucal displayed scattered pockets of buildings that glittered in different colors.

I gasped. "I see water, lots of water."

"That is the sea water and sea of animals that live underneath the water."

"I can't see the sea animals." I giggled.

"If you are finished viewing the sand and the water, you will want to see the city."

"Yeah," I turned and slid beside Ucal, pressing a nose bridge into the window with a gasp and a smile. "So pretty, each building is designed like a..."

"Castle, this is the term that all the sea people like to use."

"Sea people?"

"Yeah, they are called the sea people. They live on the edge of the sea and the sand and the sun."

"Okay, the sea people live in colored castles."

"They are called sand castles."

I giggled. "I like that name, sand castles and sea people."

"Each building was three stories high and designed in a tall oval with a set of scattered windows. The rooftop was tall and shaped like a smooth cone that matched the building. Each building was a solid color of electric blue, dull red, light green, dull yellow or bright orange."

I gasped. "So beautiful..."

The limousine slowly flew and halted in the air wave, slowly dropping down and landed over the colored sand in front of a new three story building. The driver killed the engine and slid from the seat, turning and opened the door for Igala only.

Sea Castle Inn

Entrance doors setting

I turned and slid across the leather seat with a grin and a giggle, standing upright in the bright sunshine and the light breeze. The sun attacked my eyeballs. I lifted and shifted a hand over my eyeballs. The air temperature was heated and hot. I sweated immediately inside my new dress.

Ucal stood upright from the beach seating and stood beside Igala, moving ahead into the open archway of the building, reaching out and grabbed her hand. "Let's get inside before I melt. Phew! It is hot here." He led and stopped a few feet inside the open room that appeared to be the greeting reception lobby of building, yelling out loud. "Hello in here! My name is Ucal. We have arrived. Hello in there!"

I gathered my skirt and moved ahead, stopping beside Ucal in silence, scanning the room.

The room was tall with a cathedral ceiling that reached into the top of the building. The room was built in a circle. The forward curvy wall contained a set of separate flush matching curvy undivided windows that showed off the colored sand, the bright sunrays, the blue water on the beach, and the missing limousine.

The limousine had moved from the entranceway and parked inside another building away from the heat and the sand.

The interior guts of the room held a several sections of living room furniture, consisting of aqua colored long sofas with a pattern of pink tinted fish and a set of oversized sitting lavender colored chairs with a pattern of white starfish. There were a set of scattered low and side tables between the sitting furniture that were made of glittering glass composite of smooth sand.

In the center of the room, there was a beautiful solid colored electric blue twirling steps of a staircase that led to up the second floor. The third didn't exist. It was only the filled with a set of scattered curved shaped viewing window.

I looked up with a smile to see the blue sky and the white clouds. "The room is pretty."

Ucal shouted with a fake smile of annoyance. "Hello. My name is Ucal. We have arrived for the Tour of Zulu Time. Hello..."

In the rear of the room, it showed the rest of the continuous curvy wall that held a set of scattered flush glass windows which conformed around the circular building. There was a wide archway of solid glass doors. The doors slid opened.

A couple of peopled emerged through the archway, wiping off the sweat with a hand and held an umbrella over a shaven head.

I gasped with giggle. "Our hosts..."

Ucal gasped with a smile, extending a hand with a nod to the male of the couple. "I guess. Hi! My name is Ucal..."

The couple was older in years, wearing a tone of very pale skin and a shaven head. The face of the male was clean shaven, also. The male wore a set of green, red, blue, and yellow stripped swimming trunks, traveling down to the top of the kneecaps, covering the private parts, not the exposed belly button. There was a pair of green and purple flip flops over his naked feet. He stopped and scooted around the center staircase, standing with a huff and a face of sweat. He wiped off the sweat without extending a hand to Ucal.

Ucal withdrew the hand with a grunt of disgust, tucking it underneath an armpit.

The female scooted around the other side of the center staircase, stopped, standing with a puff and a face of sweat. She wore a one-piece swimsuit of red and orange large flowers with a pair of blue and white flip flops.

The couple was tall and extremely overweight. The male displayed an exposed and naked pot belly that hung over the swimming trucks, without a shirt over a chest.

The female donned only the swimsuit without a shirt or a skirt, wiggling the naked toes also, twirling the umbrella over a set of hair roots with a smile.

I giggled and slapped a hand over my mouth.

Ucal cleared a throat, "Uh, hi there! We are here for the Tour of Zulu Time. I am Ucal. This is Igala..."

"Yes, yes," the male puffed from the heat in a sissy whine. "You are on time. Your sleeping chamber suite is these stairs. Girls on the right. Guys on the left. You can store your luggage and refresh inside your room first, if you feel like it."

Ucal nodded with a smile. "Our driver will tote and store our luggage for us inside each room. We are ready to begin our presentation, now. We are scheduled to present at the mealtime."

"Yes, yes," the female puffed from the heat in a sissy whine and a smile. "We are about set down for our brunch time meal. You can speak during our meal. Come along! The auditorium is across the way."

I gathered the long dress into a ball at the side for walking and moved ahead with Ucal with a smile. "What is this place? Your city is beautiful."

The female back stepped and slowly turned with a puff and a burp to face the set of closed sliding glass doors. "This is the Sea Castle Inn. This is the place where guests stay when visiting." She slowly waddled toward the doors.

The doors automatically slid sideways to open.

The male back stepped and slowly moved even with the female, exiting into the sunshine and held an umbrella over a shaven head of white, slowly waddling across the colored sands on a pair of flip flops, sweating in the heat. He grunted and wiped the sweat from a face with a small cloth.

The building stood slightly to the side of the Sea Castle Inn. It was taller and wider, posing at five foot with larger windows.

The couple slowly marched across the sands with an umbrella over a bald hair root with a soft grunt and a loud burp. Ucal and I raced across the sand, following behind the king and queen-sized couple with a set of smiles and chuckles.

Sea Castle Auditorium

Ground floor

Dining room setting

The second building was colored in dull red sand composites with a cone-shaped rooftop. There were numerous windows that were flesh against the curved walls in clear glass.

The sliding glass doors slid to the both sides to open.

The couple moved ahead and entered a very large room, turning to face the first tray of food against the wall. The outer space of the room held one continuous curvy table against the continuous curved wall, where numerous trays provided an individual steaming and piled high food entree.

In front of the continuous curved table, there were sets of small to large oval shaped tables with occupants. The occupants were the sea people. Each sea person including adults, teens, and children wore a piece of swimming attire with a head of shaven hair, also. Each one displayed a tone of stark white glowing skin and a body of very large proportions with rolls of fat on the neck, both arms, the waist, and the legs.

"Get a plate of food and sit down, anywhere." The male waved a fat hand and stood in front of first table with a tall column of new dishes. He selected one and moved down the food line.

Ucal and I entered the room and stood a few feet from the doors with a smile. He gently shoved Igala toward the first table of plates and food. "Igala, you go first. I will follow behind you, gorgeous."

I turned toward the first food table with a smile. The food odors drifted up and over the ceiling, smelling good. I strolled ahead and stopped, grabbing a plate, picking out the food item. I slowly moved around the continuous table, selecting almost one of each food item. At the end of the table, I carried two plates of food with a grin and a giggle.

I slowly back stepped from the last food tray and spun around, moving to the first empty chair inside the second table from the side wall. The chair was slid out from the glass table for sitting. I placed the two plates of food over the glass surface of the eating table with a smile and sat down inside the chair.

The chair slowly shifted and moved ahead, parking underneath the edge of the table, without instructions or feet movement.

I gasped with a giggle at the moving piece of furniture, grabbing the sides of the chair with a smile. I didn't have a pair of gloves or the re-designer purse that matched the sequined dress, since I had left these particular items inside the luggage. I didn't want another thievery problem from the younger children and older teenagers.

I really did not mind, but my mom Henoana would want an explanation of another pair of missing gloves.

The little girl sat next to Igala on a pair of naked kneecaps and mouth spat a set of food particles across her lap, the plate, and the glass table, wearing a two-piece bathing suit with a shaven head and a smile of paleness pointed at the purse. "I like the green vegetable. The taste is sweet."

I shifted to the side and avoided the flying food particles from the mouth of the child with disgust and a fake smile.

The obese teen girl wore a set of food stained lips and a smear of food on both cheekbones and mouth spat a set of used food particles from a full mouth that landed on the top of her hands, the plate, and the tablecloth. "I like the new pink colored meat. It is my favorite of all the foods."

I turned and stared with a gasp and a confused brow at the food items of the obese teenage girl.

The obese teen girl was surrounded by a set of four platters of food. There was a large platter of meats in various colors in pink or brown. There was a platter of vegetables that shown in bright to dull colors of red, green, yellow, and white. There was a third platter of breads in colors white or dark brown. And there was a fourth plate of fruits, where the fruits varied in colors and sizes of red, blue, purple, orange, green, and pink.

I looked down with a confused brow to see my two eating plates. One plate held a series of one type of foods, a meat, two different cooked vegetables, and one piece of bread. The other plate was smaller with a piece of sweet dessert. I reached over and grabbed the fork with a smile, stabbing the cooked vegetable and stuffed into an open mouth, chewing.

The overweight middle aged short adult female sat between the overweight little girl and the overweight teen girl wearing a set of food stained lips and a dab of food on a nose bridge and mouth spat a set of food particles across the plate and the glass table. Her mouth spit hit the clear glass center arrangement of dried seashells and as she mumbled with a mouth of more food. "I like new re-generated fruit. It is so tasty and sweet."

Ucal held one plate of food and spun around, moving ahead and stopped next to Igala, resting the food plate on top of the table. He sat inside the chair. The chair slid and locked underneath the table surface. He leaned over and shoved the small amount of food into an open vessel, chewing one bit and then swallowed the entrée. He was eager to talk to the full audience about Zulu Time.

I stared at the used lump of food particles on the glass vase and gagged, lifting and spitting out the chewed food into the provided cloth napkin with a cough of disgust.

The overweight teen tall male sat next to the overweight teen short female, wearing a face of food stains on both cheekbones, the nose bridge and the chin. He turned and chewing with an open mouth, spitting out a set of food particles across the plate of the female, the floor, and the glass table. "I like the new bread. This one is brown colored. This one is red colored. This one is white colored..."

I watched the used food. It came out of the mouth of the overweight teen male and hit the glass table. I turned and gagged with a cough and as, my eyeballs darted to other side of the eating table at Ucal.

Ucal finished eating and slid the plate forward, wiping off the mouth and stood with a stern face. He turned and advanced ahead to the obese male that had greeted him inside the Sea Castle Inn, stopping and standing over the shaven head with a smile. "Sir, I am ready to begin the presentation with your permission."

The male chewed with a mouthful of food with a nod in silence.

Ucal twisted a face to find a podium for speaking, seeing only the continuous table and the wall. "Where do I stand?"

The male turned with a mouthful of food and pointed to the front of the room near the entrance of the sliding glass doors in silence, chewing the entree. The fat finger pointed at an empty space between a set of oval shaped tables.

"Thank you, sir." Ucal nodded with a smile and turned, marching to the empty space, stopped and spun around with a grin, looking around for a microphone between the floor, the food trays, and the oval tables. He couldn't find one, looking up to see the audience of shaven heads with a smile. "I am Ucal. I will be your first speaker today. I am a winner of Zulu Time. I have been traveling around the different Society Cities to offer good food and our great stories. I wanna share one with good folks here this evening...."

At the table of Igala, the middle aged short obsess female adult wore a set of food stained lips and a pair of food stains cheekbones, mouth spitting a set of food particles over her plate, the glass table, and the water, staring at Igala. "What is Zulu Time?" She sat next to her daughter, wearing a one-piece yellow and purple bathing suit with a shaven skull of glowing pale skin tone.

"It is..." I turned and scanned the room, not seeing a wall of glass that represented the monitor of programs, looking back at her. "Where are the walls of glass?"

The same middle aged short female obese adult stuffed the food into an open vessel and mouth spat out some of uneaten food over the plate and the glass table, mumbling to Igala. "We have tables of glass for our food platters."

I turned with a cough and looked down at the floor, opening a mouth for fresh air, before I puked up my breakfast from this morning, saying with a soft timber to the floor, not her open mouth. "Where is your wall of glass that shows one or more local entertainment shows?"

An elderly woman of paleness and fatness with a shaven head chewed and then mouth spat a set of used food particles, flying onto the plate and the glass table. "A screen? A show? We don't watch or see any type of show. We enjoy socializing and eating with our friends and our families. These are all my lovely friends on my left." She lifted and shoved another spoonful of food into an open mouth, revealing the chewed food particles and continued to chew. She turned to the side with a nod and mouth spat more used food particles across the empty space of the floor. "And these are my lovely family members on my right."

I lifted and covered the mouth with the cloth napkin, coughing and gagging from disgust of her food eating behavior.

Ucal turned with a smile and scanned each table, seeing an overweight individual inside a chair. The individual included children, teenagers, middle age adults and elderly adults. He cleared a throat. "I am here to discuss Zulu Time. Zulu Time is the place and the time...time..."

The extra-large middle aged man stood from the slid chair and turned with a set of food stained lips, a pair of food stained cheekbones and a set of front teeth of chewed food particles, smiling at Ucal. He swiftly waddled side to side toward the empty space between two oval tables, saying with a grin. "This is best re-designer steak which is tender, juicy, almost with a touch of sweetness. I don't recall having meat like this. I must have another three or four pieces."

The empty space was the entrance portal that led to the single sliding glass doors. The male scooted backward from his eating table and heading into Ucal. Ucal continued to stare with a gasp at the extra-large and extra tall middle aged naked glowing pale tinted back spine of the male and back stepped from the empty space, moving backward to the sliding glass doors.

The male turned with a smile of food particles and moved to the first tray of food, selecting the entrée and placed inside an open vessel, chewing on the piece of food at the table.

Ucal slowed moved back into the empty spot and turned to stare at the back spine of rude sea person, clearing a throat and twisted a fake smile and a gasp toward the audience, again.

A queen-sized adult female waddled in front of the nose bridge of Ucal. He swiftly back stepped with a sissy squeal of alert from a head-on collision. The queen-sized adult female moved ahead through the empty space and stomped inside the standing spot of Ucal, waddling ahead to the first tray of food with a dirty and empty eating plate within each hand. She yelled to the audience. "The re-designer vegetables are fabulous, crisp, vividly pretty. I must have another plate of the good food."

Ucal stood in place with a sigh in front of an oval eating table and scanned the audience again with a fake smile. "I have participated inside the Tag..."

"What is a tag?" The short and overweight elderly male adult turned to see Igala and mouth spat a set of different food particles through the air space, landing on top of her plate, the glass table. "It is a new type of re-gen fish."

The overweight little girl smiled with a set of food particles on each cheekbone, the lips, and between each tooth with a nod to see the nose profile of Igala. "I love fishies. I love to eat fishies. Are they colored fishies or white fishies?"

I closed my eyelashes and lifted the clean part of the dirty napkin, smelling the foul odor of my breath, covering my mouth. I was about to toss out a tongue of vile green puke across my plate and the glass table, where it might hit the wide centerpiece. I exhaled with a puff of disgust and my own drooling mouth spit, wiping it off the lips.

The elderly overweight male chewed and mouth spat a set of used food particles into the air, flying across his plate, landing on top of the glass table and the low centerpiece of dried seashells. "Zulu Time is the place and the time where those people kill those other people for fun...."

"For a crime..." I looked down with a stern face to see my plate of food without eating the rest of the food. I carried on a light conversation with the obese people of the sea. I could not bear to see any more in-flight used food particles coming out from an open vessel of a sea person even the children exhibited a set of rude eating manners during mealtime. The scene caused my gag reflex to choke inside my esophagus of mouth drool while I violently coughed.

Ucal stared at shaven head of each sea person with a fake smile. "Igala was in a car accident that placed her inside Zulu Time. The car accident was only a fender bender. No other passengers were hurt. But, Igala still was invited to Zulu Time. That isn't fair or justice. I feel the same way. This is why we are touring around the Society to tell our story. We want to share our experience here within Society City Two for Zulu Time."

The overweight middle aged male of paleness shook a shaven head at the black hair roots of Igala, flinging a set of food particles side to side from the corners of the mouth inside his lap and the floor, "Crime, there is no crime here. I don't understand why you mentioned that word, young lady."

Ucal shouted without a microphone with a fake smile to the audience. "Because of my successful win, I am here..."

"Here, there are mini-pies inside a new food tray, a new re-gene dessert." The extra-large and extremely tall overweight male turned with a smile of food particles and a pair of food stained lips and a painted nose bridge of food, holding a dessert in each hand with a smile of food between the teeth.

Each chair slid from a table and stopped. Then each food lover stood from a chair and turned to waddle toward the food table.

At the table of Igala, I continued to sit and stare down at the plate of food. The occupants moved from the table to investigate the new re-gene dessert against the far wall. A hand landed on top of my collar bone as I gasped in shock.

Ucal had moved from the empty space at the front of the room and stopped, standing over the hair roots of Igala, leaning down into her eardrum with a growl, "We are leaving, right now..."

I exhaled with a smile. "Shore thing, yes sir." I reached down and placed the napkin inside the plate of food, feeling terrible for leaving without eating and stood with a sour frown. I could see the remnants of lumps of used food particles that had splattered over the pretty colored pink tinted glass table and gagged, slapping a hand over my mouth.

He reached over and grabbed her free hand, swinging them to face the set of sliding glass doors, moving swiftly around the other colorful mouth-spit-covered eating tables.

I mumbled with a hand over my mouth. "Our host and hostess..."

"I mumbled our apologies while he stood in line to taste the new re-gen desert. He nodded in silence while eating something blue colored." Ucal frowned.

The door slid sideways open.

Ucal moved across the colored sands in the bright sunshine toward the set of sliding glass doors on the Sea Castle Inn in silence.

I held his hand and moved slightly behind his back spine, exhaling with a puff of relief and sniffed the fresh air, tasting salt from the sea water, feeling heated from the hot sun.

Sea Castle Inn

12:22 pm (early afternoon)

Hot temperatures with bright sunshine

Entrance doors setting

Ucal stepped toward the rear doors of the Sea Castle Inn. The door automatically parted open from his body heat signature. He moved ahead and stopped at the foot of the staircase.

I followed behind and stood in front of the staircase with a smile. "I'm hunger and hot. Let's go and change and then have a food picnic at the beach. It'll be fun."

The front door slid open with a pair of Regulators.

I felt the heat on my back spine, twisting with a sour frown at the twinkling golden pair.

Ucal turned with a nod to see the pair of Regulators. "We can't. I gotta hunt down the limo with our bags of personal clothing first. Then I must talk with the Regulators about the non-fun event. I was not able to thoroughly communicate about Zulu Time and the Tag with the audience, again. It is so..."

"Yeah, I understand completely." I spun around and stomped onto the first step with a sour frown, gathering the dress and slowly moved up the staircase in the tight sequin dress, feeling betrayed and lonely and frustrated again. I did not like Zulu Time and did approve of the Tag concept. I didn't want to travel around and visit all the different Society Cities with the landscape, either.

Her mom Henoana had accepted the invitation for her daughter and confirmed with the Regulator.

I didn't care about Zulu Time and felt a little frightened at first with the entire Tour of Zulu Time. Then, I felt comfortable around Ucal during the limousine trip. Now, I felt lonely without Ucal.

This seemed to be some type of education session class for Ucal to update the rest of the citizens about Zulu Time and the Tag, not Igala.

I stomped both sandals on top of the second floor that was covered in electric blue color also. The hallway was rectangular in shape and split into a set of two separate corridors to the right or to the left. The forward wall of electric blue sand composites showed an array of square shaped windows that showed off an assortment of colored buildings of Society City Two as far as the eyeballs could see on the second story of the building. On each side, there was a single door which was closed and made of the same color of pretty electronic blue. I stood in place with a puzzled brow, swinging around to see down below on the ground floor.

Ucal and the pair of Regulators were whispering and head nodding with each other inside a secret meeting of words.

I felt left out and isolated, remembering something. The male host said that the girl suite was on the right. I swung around with a giggle and moved over the smooth sand composite floor with a grin to the door.

The door automatically opened without pressing a button or humming a word inside the private suite for Igala.

I entered and dragged the long dress hem through the archway and halted with a smile and a giggle at the male on top of the aqua colored sofa of purple fish. The door automatically closed behind my back spine. I lifted the dress up my kneecaps. He sat on top of the sofa and clapped with a smile. I flung the sandal over the floor and the other with a giggle.

"I have it, miss." Dfee chuckled.

I smiled at him. "And, I want it, sir."

He patted a lap with a smile. "No, you come and get, miss."

I smiled. "No, you come and take it, sir."

He stood with a smile and dashed ahead, stopping and stood in place, lifting up the plate of food into her nose bridge.

I reached out with a nod and grabbed the plate with a giggle, eating the food items. The sea people and their eating habits had dimmed my appetite inside the auditorium but not here inside my private suite.

He wrapped an arm around her waist, leaning over and kissing her cheekbone, pulling back with a smile.

I felt his soft lips and mint breath on my cheekbone, since my mouth was full of food. I chewed and swallowed with a worried brow. "Dfee, you gotta leave. The Regulators haven't seen or caught you now, but the day is sunny and long." I ate and chewed the good food.

He held both hands around her waist and moved backward with a smile, entering the bedroom suite in silence.

I held the plate and chewed the food, swallowing with a sour frown, "No, the answer is no."

He continued to move backward and halted at the window. "Look out the window. That is the sea."

I chewed and swallowed the food, turning to see miles of bluish-green waves of ocean and miles of colored in the sunshine, "Water?"

"Have you ever been such beauty, beauty?"

I turned and smiled at him. "No."

"Me, either."

I nodded with a stern face. "Look, I wanna feel the sand, too. But, I can't leave the suite. Is there another secret carriage inside this electric blue colored building for us to escape within my private room?" I chewed and swallowed the food.

"No."

"Is there a back door or something?" I ate, chewed, and swallowed the food.

"No."

"Is there a side door or something?" I ate, chewed, and swallowed the food.

"No."

I gasped. "Then, how do we leave the building?" I ate, chewed, and swallowed the food.

"There is the first door. No one is in here. I saw Ucal leave with the Regulators, the limousine, and your luggage."

I exhaled. "Dang, he did that, again. I don't have any more clothing besides this dress." I reached over and place the empty food on top of the side table near the bed frame.

He grinned. "You don't need any more clothing." I grunted. Dfee laughed. "Okay, you wear the dress. We walk on the beach and come back for lunch. I promise. I stole a refrigerator of food for us."

I smiled, "Alright, only because, I wanna eat lunch and supper without the sea people."

He spun around and grabbed her hand, moving ahead, leaving the bedroom and marched toward the door.

The door opened.

They exited and moved down the circular staircase in silence, dashing through the sliding glass doors into the heated sunshine and stopped.

I gasped and pointed at the object. "What is this?"

He scooted around and lifted her into the air, placing Igala over the back seat of the bicycle with a smile. "It's a solar operated bicycle for two people. Hop on! We're going to see the waves in style." Dfee side stepped and slid onto the seat with Igala, touching the handle bars and started the engine.

The solar bicycle for two lifted up from the sand and flew ahead, soaring over the colored sands and away from the Sea Castle Inn for privacy.

On top of the sandy beach among the hot temperature, cold ocean waters, and the bright sunlight, Dfee slowed and halted the solar bike in the air waves, slowly dropping it down onto the sands and killed the engine with a smile. "Here, we're at the sea!" He slid out and turned, assisting her from the back seat.

I stood in a pair of naked foot over the sand over the first time with a smile in silence. The sand was soft, rough, and heated. I side stepped and stood a pair of naked feet inside the water, feeling cool, salty, and grassy with an array of tiny plants of sea moss.

Dfee moved beside Igala and grabbed her hand, strolling ahead over the ankle-deep warm water, swinging both hands. He turned and frowned at her nose profile. "You looked puzzled, beauty."

"I am puzzled."

He chuckled. "O! I can read your mind."

I giggled. "O really?"

He smiled. "Really!"

"How is that?"

"Because, we are alike and are meant to be tighter and together."

I giggled, "O, really."

He smiled. "O! The sea people are kinda alarming in appearance."

I exhaled. "How did you know that?"

"I know you and me. I understand you and me."

I exhaled. "I don't understand the sea people. The sun is so bright and warm..."

"Hot..."

"The sea water is so pretty and warm..."

"Salty..."

"The sea people don't seem to enjoy the sun, the sand, and the beach...."

"Only food," he laughed. "They are too busy eating which accounts for their extra appearance and lack of interest with any activity like strolling with a pretty girl or swimming with a pretty girl...

"I can't swim in a formal ankle-length gown, Defeat."

"Naw, beauty! Dfun, Dfit, Dwit, Dfee, that's me." He laughed.

"There was not a wall of glass inside the dining room auditorium to view a program, especially Zulu Time. And they told me that there was no crime here."

He exhaled and kicked the water with a pair of naked feet. "I believe you and them. The sea people are too busy eating to worry about stealing something from someone else other than a shaker of salt." He laughed. "Do you get my joke, beauty? The sea is made of salt. So, they would steal a shaker of salt. But, there is really not a shaker of salt..."

I giggled. "I get your silly non-joke. So, why are we bothering with a Tour of Zulu Time? The sea people have never heard of Zulu Time. The sea people don't possess a wall of glass to exhibit a televised program, either."

He exhaled. "I can't answer that, beauty. I would guess you should ask Ucal."

"I can't ask Ucal. He wouldn't know the reason."

He smiled. "Does it really matter, beauty? After all, you are seeing the other Society Cities that no one citizen within Society City four will ever see..."

"With you..."

"With you, too," He stopped and turned, standing in place and leaned over, kissing her lips, pulling back with a smile. "Now, we know why we both are here on the beach, all alone."

I gasped with a giggle and turned, scanning the sand, the sea, and back to Dfee. "I can't do that."

"You can do that."

"I can't do that."

"Yes, you can do that."

I slapped the gown with both hands and a sour frown. "I got on a long gown."

"It's made of sequins. Sequins don't drown in water."

"Dfee?"

"I promise that sequins didn't drown in water."

I exhaled. "I will ruin my new gown."

He winked. "Then, you can remove your gown and ruin me."

"Naw."

"Yeah." He nodded with a laugh.

I exhaled. "No, I will not remove my gown, but I will choose to ruin it."

"Good," he reached down with a chuckle and grabbed her hand, back stepping and turned to face the water with a grin. "We're going swimming."

I gasped with fear. "I will drown in the water."

He laughed. "I just told you, beauty, that sequins don't drown in water." He led and jerked her hand forward, strolling deeper into the sea water, moving on top of the sand with a chuckle.

I moved over the sand, not feeling the water rise over my ankles with a gasp, looking down at the water. "I feel sand and water, but I don't feel more water over my feet."

"This is a sandbar that connects the shoreline to sea. We are literally walking over the water. If only my mama could see me now?" He laughed.

"A lump of sand that connects the shoreline to the sea," I twisted a worried face to see the shoreline as it looked further away from my eyeballs. "I have seen enough of a sandbar, Dfee. I wanna see the shoreline, again." I ran into the back spine of Dfee with a sneer.

Dfee stopped and spun around with a smile. "Here, this is a good spot. The sand is thick. The sun is bright. The sea is very deep. And your smile is beautiful."

"I am not smiling. I am sneering." I released his hand and moved around the sand. The sand was shaded into a teardrop figure as the colored sand glittered from the right sunlight. "And what do we do here on the sand?"

He smiled. "The nouns both start with the letter S. I was close enough. Well, we could sing and dance for the sea gods or sea gulls or sea pods," he wiggled both hips and danced across the sand side to side, splashing the water at her with a chuckle.

I back stepped and cross both arms with a growl. "I wanna go back to the shoreline. My dress is ruined..."

"Beauty, there's a giant wave coming at her butthole. Duck down into the sand!" She gasped and dropped down over the sandbar, covering a face. He stood upright with a smile and a laugh. "I'm sorry. It was a false alert, beauty."

I stood upright with a sneer, "Beast!"

He bowed both arms and moved closer to her. "Naw! It is Dfun, Dfit, Dwit, Dfee. That's me."

I moved backward from him with a sneer. "I wanna get off the sandbar, now."

"That's not a good idea." He leaned over and viewed the water. "The edge of a sandbar is only sea water that goes down and down deep underneath the sand."

I moved backward with a sneer. "I wanna get off the sandbar."

"Look around you! The sea water is calm. The sand is flat. The sun is shining. The moment is perfect. And I am here with you." He winked with a smile.

I turned and stared at the sea, the sand, the sun, and Dfee, hiking the dress up to the kneecaps, showing off the naked feet and moved backward into the water with a giggle.

Dfee smiled with a nod. "Beauty, come back to me."

I back stepped further from him and over the sandbar, tossing both hands into the air, extending a wiggling pink tongue for fun.

He moved ahead and waved both hands with a worried brow. "Come back to me, beauty."

I back stepped further from him with a smile.

He moved ahead with a worried brow. "Igala, there's a big wave coming."

"I do not fail, twice." I swung around with a gasp to see the single wave of high surf.

Two arms wrapped around her waist, lifting her from the water. The wave plowed into the shirt of Dfee. "Good one!" He slowly lowered her down into the sand which was surrounded by blue water.

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance and slapped the dress. "I'm wet."

"I'm wetter." He laughed and slapped the clothing with a smile.

I sneered. "I wanna to go back to the shoreline."

He looked up with a smile to see the shoreline. "O dear! We can't."

"We can."

"We can't."

"Of course, we can." I growled.

He sneered. "Of course, we're stuck out here on the sandbar, all alone, the two of us."

"What?" I gasped.

"The wave has injured your head, beauty. We are stuck out here on the sandbar, all alone."

I gasped. "What are we going to do on a sandbar, all alone?"

"O no..." He laughed.

I turned and frowned at the water and the sand. "O no, I'm stuck on the sandbar."

He smiled into her face. "O no! You and I are stuck on the sandbar, together."

I turned and smiled at him. "How do we get off the sandbar?"

He chuckled. "We don't get off the sandbar."

"Dfee?"

"We have to wait for low tide."

I turned and frowned at the water and the shoreline beach, "How long until low tide?"

He pulled her closer into his lips with a smile, "In about an hour or so, then we walk on water to sand like a Greek god and goddess, beauty."

I turned and winked at him, dropping down over the flat and wet colored sands. "So, what do we do for an hour or so on top of an isolated sandbar, without rescue?"

He dropped down on top of her with a smirk and a chuckle, "O no! I don't know."

"O no! I do know." I leaned over and kissed his soft lips.

He pulled with a frown. "Ouch!"

"What?" I frowned.

He reached down and touched the wet shiny sequins with a chuckle. "Your sequins feel like fins of a fishie on my wet shirt and naked arms..."

"Dfee!"

"Dwit, Dfit, Dfun, Dfee, that's me!" He leaned down and kissed her lips for eternality.

The waves rolled around the sandbar and moved through the shoreline with the seagulls and the bright sunrays as the young couple groaned and moaned over the colored sands all alone.

Inside the local Zulu Time satellite station, the pink colored building was the tallest structure within Society City Two for a reason. Ucal was escorted by a pair of tall Regulators and stopped, standing between an additional two Regulators in the middle of the large room that held different walls of glass.

The tall Regulator stood on the left side of Ucal and pointed to the display tiny glass screen without a smile or an emotion. "There, she is there. Why is she? And who is he?"

Ucal stared at the glass screen with a chuckle and a nod. "Duh, she is a girl. He is a boy. And they are doing a series of girl and boy things on top of a sandbar in the middle of the sea water."

The short Regulator stood on the right side of Ucal and watched the couple on the glass screen. "Why are you not with Igala, Ucal?"

"She doesn't like me, sir." Ucal looked down with a sad face to see the sandy floor of colored quartz from the boot soles of the Regulators.

The tall Regulator turned and stared down at the strawberry blonde hair roots of Ucal. "You and she are the two winners of Zulu Time. You and she are the cute couple of the Zulu Time. You and she should be together on the sandbar in the middle of the sea water. Why is this not happening?"

Ucal looked up with a sad face to see the couple on the tiny glass screen. "She doesn't like me, sir."

"How did she get out of her suite?" The tall Regulator turned and stared at the tiny glass screen too.

The short Regulator stared at the couple on the glass screen. "Igala is an invited guest of Zulu Time. She can attend any part of the Society City Two without an escort."

The tall Regulator stared at the couple on the monitor. "Ucal, your work in Zulu Time has finished for the day. Tomorrow, you will leave very early after sunrise for Society City Five with Igala."

"Yes sir," Ucal back stepped from the tiny screen on the wall with a stern face and spun around, exiting the control room with the Satellite Building within Society City Two.

The tall Regulator side stepped toward the short Regulator without a smile or an emotion. "Congratulations, Regulator! You have proven the hard evidence without any doubt that the citizens love Zulu Time. I am recommending phase two be implemented, immediately." He looked back over a collar bone. "And I believe that we need to get her undivided attention away from any and all external influences for the sake of Ucal." The short Regulator nodded in silence and back stepped from the monitor and her husband, swinging around and exited the control room.

Ucal stood in the wall corner of the dark hallway, following the back spine of the short Regulator, racing from the wall and dashed, tapping onto the collar bone of the Regulator with a stern face, "Mom."

The short Regulator stopped and spun around without a smile, droning in alto timber, "Ucal, sweetheart."

"Mom," Ucal turned with a worried brow and scanned an empty hallway and his mom. "What's going on here? I did what you asked. Igala competed in Zulu Time, winning it all. Why is she being monitored by the Regulators from Society City Four? She hasn't done anything wrong here. She and her family are just one of many winners of Zulu Time. Why are the Regulators focusing on her?"

She said. "Are you jealous that Dfee is with Igala?"

Ucal looked down with a sad face to see the floor and then his mom. "No. He is competition. She likes him and me. I'm not really worried."

"I have proven to the other Society Cities that the citizens of Society City Four love the Zulu Time program. That was my experiment using Igala and her family members."

He frowned. "That sounds like a sick madman science experiment, Mom. I didn't understand your ploy. The citizens of Society City Four watch Zulu Time at home on a wall of glass like nesting spiders."

"The citizens crave blood-lust. Zulu Time feeds that blood-lust. A citizen is like a hunter waiting on the deer. During the time of your grandfather, a hunter would hide among the brown colored branches within the tree for hours, sometimes days, waiting for a buck to graze the grass below just to destroy the beautiful creature."

"I learned from my teacher-robot during on-line sessions that ancient hunters hunted female does and male bucks for food, skin, and entertainment, Mom."

"Today, food is re-generated. Clothing is re-generated. Animals are not kept and caged for torment or exhibition. And hunting is outlawed unless you own land acres. The citizens are not entertained unless they focus on Zulu Time. You have heard them. They are silence, only breathing while watching and anticipating the first cry of pain, the last fling of blood, the flood of anguish."

He chuckled. "That is really a scary horror picture show, Mom."

She frowned. "This is the reality of Zulu Time, a reality horror show, every night for your viewing pleasure on plasma."

He chuckled. "And that sounds like a slick advertisement for the scary horror picture show, too."

She frowned. "At first, Zulu Time served a purpose, a good purpose. The victims were satisfied and vindicated. I mean really. How can a family ever become satisfied, when a love one is killed by a drunk driver? Or the loved one is murdered over possessions? Or the loved one is killed over money? Zulu Time eliminated those terrible acts of crime. But then, Zulu Time became the crime, itself. Any minor incident, such like, a bent car fender, a spit onto the heated sidewalk or a shove through the door, then the victim was too easily identified a criminal. Society City Four dictates that every victim and every criminal fights and tries to survive within Zulu Time."

He turned and frowned at the wall and his mom. "Igala was an innocent victim, not a murderous criminal." She nodded in silence. Ucal exhaled. "I see, very clearly, now, Mom. Igala only tapped the rear bumper of the parked vehicle, but the family of car still claimed the right of Zulu Time."

"Yes, the Vee team also wants the homestead property, the coin accounts, and other material possessions of the Cee team. Zulu Time was not meant to gather assets, Ucal. It was setup for the family of the victim to use all the newly acquired assets as the one-time compensation of loss life. A loss life cannot be priced tag or brought or compensated within my opinion. A loss life is gone, never to return," exhaling. "But some folks feel that it serves a greater purpose. I am going to destroy the blood-lust coming from Zulu Time, Ucal, even if it means destroying Zulu Time itself."

He nodded with a stern face. "And I am going to help you, Mom. How does my dad feel?"

"He feels the same. However, some of our golden kin do not feel, because they do not possess any other emotion, except for the blood-lust."

"Mom, the Regulators are powerless. They simply are puppets on a string. They are only massagers," he laughed.

"They are the new messengers of death," She sneered with a nod. "Once I have destroyed Zulu Time, the Regulator will be established as an old-fashion law authority of the land, doling out justice and reward of peace, not pious. Good back to your sleeping suite, Ucal. You will leave very early tomorrow morning. I will continue to monitor them on top of the sands."

Ucal spun around with a sour frown and a growl, thinking of Igala and Dfee, seeing them on the television screen. However, his mom would take care of it for her son, very swiftly and very secretive.

He stomped through the open archway of the isolated building inside Society City Two, slumping forward both shoulders and a skull from getting whacked on the rooftop of the limousine.

The driver closed the door and turned, moving into the front seat, preparing the vehicle for flight. Then, the limousine lifted from the sand and flew forward and gently turned, carrying Ucal back to the Sea Castle Inn for the evening.

The driver dropped down the vehicle over the sand and exited from the front seat, turning to open the rear door without a goodbye hand gesture to Ucal.

06:55 pm (Early evening Society City Four Time Zone)

Hot temperatures and bright sunshine

Sea Castle Inn

Entrance way setting

Ucal slid out the open door and marched ahead into the lobby of the electric blue building, feeling sadness and disappointment. Dfee had again beaten him to the full attention and beautiful body of Igala, since the duty of the Regulators were interference with the fun of Ucal. He could really be angry at Dfee as much as jealous for having fun with Igala.

The Tour of Zulu Time was showing off the Tag team of Igala and Ucal to the rest of the citizens.

He marched again and climbed the circular stairway of steps without stopping and reached the top of the hallway, seeing the pretty blue sky of the pretty day with a sigh of depression.

Inside his private suite, Ucal moved through the sitting room, ignoring the new buffet of steaming food trays.

The door automatically closed behind his back spine.

He entered the bedroom and stopped a few feet from a nicely decorated bed mattress with a sour frown, looking down with a blank face and a sigh of disappointment at his com-d and heard the familiar music. "Zulu Time is here already. And I am alone again, tonight." He lifted and climbed onto the top of the nice set of bedcovers, getting the dark blue colored fabric dirty with a pair of sand covered cowboy boots without a care, lifting and brought the com-d into a sour face to watch the program for the night.

Society City Four

07:01 pm (early evening)

Zulu Time Building location

Interior tan colored room setting

Warm temperatures and cloudy sky

The music played a new slow song of harps and violins on a screen of blue and black wiggling lines. The voices of Jackie and Jamie said with a smile within the darkness of the wall of glass. "Welcome to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!" Each wall of glass inside a home within Society City Four changed and showed the inner guts of Zulu Time room in the colors of tan. The forward wall was empty.

Two side doors on the curved wall slid open.

A pale skinned female exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female exited from the second side door. Both females scooted across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated in a tight circle, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jackie and Jaime Jones."

Jackie slowly twirled in a tight circle in a short body fitting sleeveless dress of bright red and white horizontal strips with a matching pair of red tinted thigh high boots. A forehead, a neck, and both of her arms was covered in colorful yellow and pink, orange, and blue butterfly designs and a head ponytail of golden, silver, gray, and white stars. She smiled into each glass screen. "I am Jackie. Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice. We will explain the rules for any new audience viewers. When an injustice has occurred, each party is presented here at the Zulu Time building."

Jamie slowly twirled in a tight circle in a short body fitting sleeveless dress of slashed out fabric in tones of black, tan, and brown, exposing some of her skin. She wore a pair of brown colored thigh boots. The forehead, two cheekbones, a neck, and both her arms showed a buttercup design of peach, golden, red, and blue colors. Her black hair draped down a back spine with pastel colors of green, yellow, orange, and blue in the format of circle. "I am Jamie. Then, each party is allowed to voice their justification case within a twenty-second time limit in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your suppertime meal. After the twenty seconds has expired, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for criminal or the letter of V for victim."

Each female spun around with a smile and moved back to a closed door on curved wall inside Zulu Time.

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he smiled down at the com-d screen. "The girls are sporting a new set of short dresses, again, tonight. I wonder if that is my mom's influence. My mom likes the Zulu Time's modern and updated clothing for each citizen." Inside the Zulu Time room, the Cee team doorway slid open first.

Jamie swung around and strolled from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of three people in front of a low and long bench of soft beige colored fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of growls, finger pointing on the black tinted tiny screen, wearing formal attire of a suit tuxedo in the color of purple. Each face was decorated with a hollow outlined figure of a single skull bone with a set of two crossed human bones in the color of dark brown.

The Vee team doorway slid opened next.

Jackie spun around and strolled from the second open archway with a smile, leading a line of six people in front of the same low and long bench of soft beige fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of smiles, turning and pointing to each tiny screen on the curved wall, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of light blue color. Each face was decorated with a set of colorful green and blue outlines of a dog face. A small puppy of yellow blonde colored trailed behind the last person, wearing a bowtie of light blue around the neck. The puppy was on a dog leash, running side to side with excitement over the tan floor, staying with the shortest teen female.

Jamie and Jackie spun around and met the in the middle, twirling in tight circles with a hand wave and smile to see each glass screen.

Jackie stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of soft baby blue. My twin sister Jamie stands behind the Cee team. The Vee team claims that the young puppy was abandoned and injured on the roadside without food, water, and protection. This nice family unit found the puppy and adopted her into their loving home. The adult family members are accusing the other family unit on the other side of the room of pet abandonment with violence. The Vee team family and the puppy demand just and justice. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team."

Jamie stopped the twirl and raised an arm with a smile, speaking into an old fashioned microphone. "I am Jamie. I stand behind of the Cee team of royal purple. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty-second time period. Since, each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members and any pets that are present here inside Zulu Time."

Inside the private suite of Ucal on top of the nicely made bedcovers within Society City Two, he frowned down at the com-d, "Hmm, interesting! It is against the law to abandon any animal on the street corner without food and water. I don't understand this Zulu Time case of judgment. Why are both of these parties inside Zulu Time? The Regulators would have investigated and found the guilty party. Then, the guilty party would be present here only. This is weird."

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jackie turned with a smile and handed the microphone to the father of the Cee team in the first position of the column. Her sister Jamie turned and handed her microphone to the male of the Vee team in the first position of the column. They back stepped from the long bench and the two debating teams, standing inside an empty spot on the entrance wall, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The elderly father of the Vee team wore a light blue colored tuxedo with a dark red bowtie and a pair of matching hand gloves. On the face, there were numerous hollow outlines of green and blue puppy dog faces. He lifted the microphone to the lips and jabbed a finger at the male of the Cee team with a sneer and as, he barely heard the musical bark of the dogs on a painted face. The fun face paint sung and moved with the bones of the face. "You left this poor and defenseless three-month old puppy on the roadside..."

"We did not." The elderly male of the Cee team wore a purple colored tuxedo with a silver bowtie and a pair of matching hand gloves and a solid brown skull bone with a set of two crossed human bones on each cheekbone and the middle of the forehead. The painted symbol emitted a set of soft crunching sounds into the air wave when he spoke. He smiled into the pre-offered microphone. "You have identified the wrong party. Thus, I will win and get all your assets, stupid person."

The other family members of the Cee team joined the shout and jabbed a finger at each face of the Vee team in unison, repeating the nasty slur. "Stupid, stupid, stupid..."

The father of the Vee team yelled into the microphone with a stern face over the obnoxiously loud noise of the other family members and barking puppies on his cheekbones. "I am a veterinarian physician of all animals, who was informed about the abandoned puppy. I found the puppy and brought it into my office for an examination. All animals are tagged and linked to the family unit that purchased the pet for love and care..."

The father of the Cee team sneered and jabbed a finger at each Vee team member as the brown colored skull bone with a set of two crossed human bones on each cheekbone and the middle of the forehead made a series of crunching sounds into the air wave. "You didn't find a link to me and my family. There is not tag on that puppy. I don't know what you are talking about, old man. Is the time-limit up, now? I wanna be judged as an innocent person."

The other family members of the Cee team changed the chant, shouting and jabbed a finger at each face of the Vee team in unison, repeating the nasty slur. "Innocent, innocent, innocent..."

The father of the Vee team yelled into the microphone with a stern face over the obnoxiously loud noise of the other family members. "You are correct. I did not find an embedded tag that clearly could identify a member of your family unit which could claim the abandonment charge on the little injured puppy."

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he gasped down at the com-d. "No, there is not a good excuse to invite another family unit into Zulu Time. I like the puppy and the nice and caring family unit that adopted it. I don't understand the motive of the Vee team. This is so wrong. The Vee team members and the puppy are going to die. I plan to vote for the Vee team, but I don't know about the rest of the Society City Four. The citizens like blood and guts on either party."

The middle aged male of the Cee team laughed with a smile. "You are a dead person. I will enjoy all your wonderful assets, too."

The other family members of the Cee team changed the chant, shouting and jabbed a finger at each face of the Vee team in unison, repeating the nasty slur. "Dead, dead, dead..."

The father of the Vee team nodded with a smile and a yell into the microphone. "However, your blood proteins, the father of the Cee team, were found scattered inside the mouth and the tongue of the young puppy where you had hit the animal with a hand. Then, the puppy had bitten your arm for protection and defense."

The other family members of the Cee team gasped in silence.

The room went black.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The twenty second deadline has expired."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only."

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness. "If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl."

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he gasped with a smile down at the com-d, pressing the button, "Yeehaw! Way to go Vee team and newest member, puppy! I'm voting for you and the cute little puppy," laughing.

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jackie and Jamie smiled within the darkness in unison. "The voting is finished. Please illuminate all the glass screens now here inside Zulu Time."

All the tiny glass screens showed a black back ground with one single letter in white.

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Geez, I am amazed. Are your amazed, Jackie?"

Jackie smiled with a nod within the darkness too, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Yes, I am amazed, too. Are you amazed, too, Jamie?"

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile in unison, "The highest mathematical number wins the justification case inside the Zulu Time room which is the letter V for the victim team."

The lights of the tiny glass screens went black.

The dark room echoed in a series of screams and curses plus the sounds of rips and tears of fabric. Then, the room was silence.

A few second later, the lights illuminated inside the room.

On the forward wall, there were six objects that stood in height from the tallest down to the shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages, coming from the hair roots down to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

In front of the long bench, the father of the winning Vee team turned and gathered his family into a huddle. The wife of the man leaned down and tapped on the soft beige fabric. The lid on the bench lifted up and revealed an array of hidden weapons for the first judgment of Zulu Time.

Jackie twirled in a tight circle to see each screen with a smile. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, each Vee team member must participate and accept the judgment of Zulu Time. Thus, the Cee team has lost the justification case. Now, each Cee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of beige and the pretty color of red against the rear wall for justice. Each Cee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment, too. Thus, the Cee team is sentenced to death by means of the Vee team's fun and creative methods."

Jamie swirled around in a tight circle to see each glass screen with a smile. "Vee team, please select your pleasure. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. Pick out whatever suites your heart and your hand. This part of Zulu Time is choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Cee team member must fire one weapon at one oval shaped object and kill the wiggling object on the forward wall. A Cee team member will know a kill shot has occurred when the oval shaped object has turned into the color of rich black, covering the tan or red tape. And I do believe that our evening audience is filled with people who love their pets and care about abandoned animals, too, making the Vee team win tonight."

The father of the Vee team huddled with a set of secret whispers into the face of each family member, determining the weapons selection.

Each object on the wall of criminals wiggled side to side, sounding in a set of low, deep moans like a ghost.

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he nervously tapped on the com-d with a smile. "Hmm, what type of deadly weapons would I select to kill the row of mean people for abandoning a helpless and lonely puppy? I would use a hand gun, fast and swift. The end. Goodbye. Time to die," He laughed.

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jamie and Jackie stopped twirled and leaned against the wall, watching the Vee team in silence.

The physician of the Vee team continued to whisper in a set of secret words and pointed down at the arrays of weapons.

Each object on the wall of criminals wiggled side to side, sounding in a set of low, deep moans like a ghost inside the Zulu Time arena.

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he nervously tapped on the com-d with a smile. "Geez! Vee team, you are taking too much sweet tea time. Each person, pick a dang weapon and do it to it, now. The Vee team coupled has a set of four beautiful teenagers that are capability of holding any type of weapon. This Zulu Time session is going to last beyond midnight at this slo-mo pace."

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jamie and Jackie continued to lean against the curved wall and watched the Vee team in silence without a smile.

The father of the Vee team nodded with a stern face and turned to face the open cabinet of the bench, reaching down, grabbing one weapon at a time and handed to each member of his family unit. Each Vee team member swung around with a stern face and turned to the side, stopping and standing in front an object on the rear wall of criminals.

Each object on the wall of criminals wiggled side to side, sounding in set of low, deep moans like a ghost.

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he stared down with a gasp into the com-d. "Each family member holds the same weapon. How interesting? I don't think that I have ever seen that before."

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jamie stood beside her sister Jackie with a smile into the microphone to the audience. "The Vee team members have selected one weapon. And each family member will use the same weapon on each Cee team member that is hanging and mounted onto the forward wall. Wow, that is another new weapon from the Regulators. Is that a whip with a ball?"

Each object on the wall of criminals wiggled side to side, sounding in set of low, deep ghostly moans like a ghost.

Jackie watched the row of back spines from each Vee team member and the wall of criminals with a smile into the microphone. "There is a set of three objects on the forward wall. That is not perfect. There are six members of the Vee team. Thus, there are two Vee team members with the same weapon, standing in front of one object. This is very interesting. Under the rules of Zulu Time, each Vee team member will hit the object until the red tape turns into the color of black for the kill shot. This justification case cannot be completed until all the objects have turned into the color of rich black of death. And the first team member will start with the largest object on the wall of criminals. Regulators are not required to assist any of the Vee team. Let's dash away toward the door, Jamie."

"I'm dashing away toward the other door, Jackie." Jamie smiled.

Then, the two females turned to the side and dashed ahead toward the dark archway.

Jackie and Jaime swung around and stood inside the archway for safety with a smile and a nod in unison. "Aim high..."

Both doors slid down and closed tight.

The first and second members of the Vee team, the mother and the father stood as a couple in front of the first and tallest object on the wall of criminals. Then the father lifted up and motioned with a hand wave to his four teenage girls.

Each teen back stepped from the bench a few feet and dropped down, landing on top of her stomach inside the evening gown over the floor and covered a face with both hands for protection.

The first member of the Vee team wore a light blue colored tuxedo with a dark red bowtie and a pair of matching hand gloves. The father reached over and tapped his wife on the collar bone with a nod in silence. The wife back stepped from the bench and her husband a few feet, dropping down, landing on top of her stomach inside the evening gown and covered her face with both hands for protection, too.

The first member of the Vee team, the father parted both feet and lifted the leather whip even with the floor in a right hand, swinging the weapon back and forth within the air waves without hitting anything but air molecules. At the end of the long leather whip, there was a palm-sized ball with a set of sharp tips. The palm-sized ball flew side to side over the floor and through the air waves without hitting anything but air molecules, too."

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he stared with a gasp down into the com-d. "What is he doing? O. I see. He is protecting his family first. Now, he is swinging the whip with the spiked ball side to side without hitting the object on the wall. First, he has to hit the object. Second, since there are two Vee team members, one has to kill the object on the wall of criminals which will be indicated when the tape turns black. Geez, this is taking forever." He laughed. "I bet my mom is mad and will be assigning a time limit on death next time for each winning team member within Zulu Time, tomorrow night."

Each object on the wall of criminals wiggled side to side, sounding in set of low, deep ghostly moans.

The first member of the Vee team, the father held the pole and swung the weapon at the first target. The spiked ball soared sideways through the air and hit the tip of the spiked ball that was attached to the long leather whip at side of the tan colored tape which was the arm space on the first and largest object on the wall of criminals.

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he stared with a gasp down into the com-d. "O man, literally! The father of the Vee member did not kill the first object on the wall of criminals. That means that the second member of the Vee team will finish the death job. Geez! That dude on the wall is not even bleeding out his red blood into the tan colored tape. That tape is really thick and glued down to each body part. I bet he is in some intense aching pain but still conscious. Ugh! Each criminal on the wall feels, sees, tastes, and smells the action and their broken and bloody body parts."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the second member of the Vee team, the mother stood upright from the floor and wiped off the dust on her light blue evening dress with a stern face, moving forward and stopped, standing in front of the short bench.

She is good with that whip and the spiky ball. Geez! My mom is probably having fits about the torment of the first object on the wall of criminals. And there are two more to finish. Zulu Time does not have a time limit. I guess the team members could torment and torture the criminals all night long until the body finally dies. But that dude is not death, yet.

Not one tan colored or red colored tape has turned black. I wonder what happens next. The woman is not tired from hitting of a bag of bones, either. Yeah, she could break some of the bones inside the tan colored tape. Then he would bleed out and show the black color over the tape. Sometimes, the object on the wall is not truly dead but bleeds. Then, the blood turns the tape into black. Thus, the object eventually dies in death after suffering inside the medical ward inside the Zulu Time Building, after it is removed from the wall of criminals. But, the nice citizens don't know that, only the Regulators."

The body slowly wiggled side to side in pain, slowly flinging up and down each aching and bruised limb. The spiked ball from the sixth Vee team member continued to sail through the air around in a circle toward the third object on the forward wall and slapped the red colored taped which was the same eye socket. "Aww...." The voice of the teen male groaned with pain and as, the tan colored tape didn't change color. The body slowly wiggled side to side in pain, slowly flinging up and down each aching and bruised limb. The spiked ball from the sixth Vee team continued to sail through the air around in a circle toward the third object on the forward wall and slapping the red colored tape which was the same eye socket. "Pfft..." The voice of the teen male groaned with pain and as, the tan colored tape didn't change color. The body slowly wiggled side to side in pain without flinging up and down each aching and bruised limb.

The sixth Cee team member, the fourth teenage girl flicked a wrist and flung the spiked ball backward through the air back toward the bench and her face. The spiked ball sailed through the air and over the floor almost smashing into the entrance wall. She spun the tip of the spiked ball around in a completed circle toward the third object on the forward wall, hitting the red colored tape which was the same eye socket.

The voice of the male, the third object on the wall of criminals did not moan or groan or scream with pain and as, the tan colored tape didn't change color. The body did not wiggle or flung up arms or legs into the air.

The sixth Cee team member, the fourth teenage girl flicked a wrist and flung the spiked ball backward through the air back toward the bench and her face. The spiked ball sailed through the air and over the floor almost smashing into the entrance wall. She flung the tip of the spiked ball forward toward the third object on the forward wall, hitting the red colored taped which was the same side of the eyeball, numerous times. Finally, with the last pop of spiked ball on the side of eyeball, the red colored tap turned into rich black hue.

The third object on the wall of criminals died in silence.

The sixth Cee team member, the fourth teenage girl swung the tip of the spiked ball backward and hit the entrance wall behind over the hair roots with a puff of sadness, dropping down the handle of the whip over the soft bench, back stepping from the bench and the wall of criminals with a sneer.

The room went black.

The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness in union. "It is done."

The voice of Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "I hoped that you have enjoyed the evening program, so far."

The voice of Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "The night is still young and fresh. Sit back and stay tuned for more Zulu Time!"

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal within Society City Two, he exhaled with a stern face down at the com-d, "I am done."

He continued to stare with a stern face down at the com-d screen.

The Zulu Time room was black. Each wall of glass and the com-d of Ucal showed a set of orange and blue wiggling lines with a song of soft piano music for a few minutes.

Society City Four

08:08 pm (early evening)

Zulu Time room in tan hue

Warm temperatures and night sky of light rain

The screen wiggled sideways and showed a set of two open archways on the curved wall of tan with millions of tiny glass screens that measured in six inches by six inches.

A pale skinned female exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female exited from the second side door as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jackie and Jamie Jones."

Jackie slowly twirled in a tight circle in the same dress and facial designs with a smile to see each glass screen. "I am Jackie. Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice. We will explain the rules for any new audience attendees. When an injustice has occurred, each party is presented here at the Zulu Time building."

Jamie slowly twirled in a tight circle in the same dress and facial designs with a smile to see each glass screen. "I am Jamie. Then, each party is allowed to voice their justification case within a twenty second deadline in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your suppertime meal. After the twenty second deadline has ended, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for criminal or the letter of V for victim."

Each female spun around with a smile and moved back to a closed door.

The Cee team doorway slid open.

Jamie swung around with a smile from the open archway, leading a line of four people in front of a low and long bench of soft beige fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of mumbles and grunts, turning and pointing to each tiny television plasma screen on the curved wall, wearing a formal tuxedo of rich black. Each face was decorated with a solid black extended middle finger on each cheekbone and in the middle of the forehead.

Jackie spun around with a smile from the second open archway on the opposite wall, leading a line of five people in front of the same long bench of soft fabric and stopped. Each person stopped and scanned the room and the opposing party with a set of giggles and laughter, pointing at all the tiny screens, wearing a formal tuxedo of peach tint with a set of solid colored pink hearts on each cheekbone.

Jamie and Jackie swung around and met in middle of the room with a smile, twirling in a series of tight circles with a hand wave to see each glass screen.

Jackie stopped the swirl and raised an arm with a smile, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the mother of the Vee team in the color of sweet peach. My twin sister Jamie stands behind the Cee team. The Vee team claims that the mother of the Cee family is a reckless and incompetent hover car driver. The driver of the Cee team raced and whipped her car in front of the family vehicle of the Vee team, using rude and dangerous driving manners. So, this family unit demands just and justice. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team."

Inside the private suit of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he gasped with worry, staring down into the com-d screen. "What is that middle aged woman doing inside Zulu Time? She has one, two, three, four and five little babies with her. Geez! My mom is going nuts right now at the sight of a mother and her little children who will face death in Zulu Time."

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jamie stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Cee team in the color of dark rich black. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice their side of the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence which would be allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty-second time period. Since, each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jackie reached out with a smile and held the microphone into the lips of the female of the Vee team in the first position of the column, since the mother of the children was holding the twin babies in both arms, turning with a smile and a nod to see hostess Jackie.

Her sister Jamie turned and handed her microphone to the female of the Cee team in the first position of the column. Jamie back stepped from the bench, her sister Jackie, and the two debating teams, standing alone against the empty space on the wall, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The adult middle-aged mother of the Vee team wore a soft peach tuxedo over her queen-sized body with a set of solid pink hearts on each cheekbone and a smile. "I was inside the proper air lane, waiting my turn to exit off from the interwave roadway and onto the street of my home when another hover car rushed around the corner lane and pulled in front of my grill. I had to slam down onto the auto brakes to keep from hitting the rear bumper..."

"Bad driver..." The female of the Cee team jabbed a finger and a sneer at the mother female of the Vee team. "You are a bad driver. I'm a good driver. I don't understand why I'm here at all with my family. She didn't hit me. I didn't hit her."

The mother of the Vee team rocked side to side, holding both twin babies, staring with a smile at the mother of the Cee team as the pink lips smacked with sweet tweet sounds. "You are here due to my children. My children are precious to me. My children were all inside the airship cabin with me. If something had happened, my children would have been injured or even killed due to your illegal driving habits."

"Bad mother..." The Cee team member, the female jabbed a finger at each child with an evil grin. "All of your children, including the bratty twin newborns, are going to be permanently injured here inside Zulu Time, old lady. You should have kept your big mouth shut and stayed your fat fanny at home for the evening of Zulu Time." The two other mature daughters of the mother hissed and jabbed a finger at the mother of the Vee team.

The mother of Vee team rocked side to side, holding both twin babies with a smile. "I am here for all the little innocent children that cannot speak for themselves. You are a reckless driver and a mean person. This is the purpose of just and justice within Zulu Time."

"You were not injured, old lady. I was not injured. See? Look at my body. I am in fine shape. You need a nose job, thou." The female of the Cee team spun around and twirled in a complete circle, stopping with a laugh and a grin at the mother of the Vee team.

The twin babies started to softly cry like a set of mewing kittens. The mother of the Vee team exhaled with a smirk. "You have rude driving manners inside the interwave lanes. You should lose your driving privileges. But I will settle on you, losing your life."

The mother of the Cee team gasped with a sour frown. "Me! It is you, old lady."

The room went black.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The twenty seconds deadline has expired."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only."

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness. "If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl."

Inside the private suit of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he nodded with a laugh down at the com-d screen. "Way to go, mother of many babies! Yes, you deserve to win Zulu Time. Yes, the other mean female and her family deserve death in Zulu Time. I am voting for the mother with the sweet little babies." He reached down and pressed the button with a smile and a nod in silence.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the voice of Jackie said with a smile beside the mother of the Vee team and stared at each black tinted screen within the darkness. "The voting is finished.

The voice of Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "Please illuminate all the glass screens now inside Zulu Time."

All the tiny glass screens showed a black back ground with one single letter in white.

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "O might, Jackie!"

The voice of Jackie said with smile within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens also. "O might goodness, Jamie!"

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile in unison within the darkness. "The highest mathematical number wins the justification case inside the Zulu Time room which is the letter V for the victim team."

The lights on each tiny glass screen went black.

The dark room echoed in a series of loud screams and harsh curses plus the sounds of soft rips and loud tears of fabric. Then, the room was silent.

A few seconds later, the overhead lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room.

On the forward wall, there were four objects. They stood in height from the tallest down to the shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages, coming from the hair roots down to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

The mother of the winning Vee team spun around with a smile and moved ahead to the entrance wall, stopping and dropped down to both kneecaps. The first little girl was three years old swung around and followed her mom, standing next to the sweet pink colored cheekbone of the mother with a grin and a giggle without words. The mom leaned over and whispered into the face of the three-year-old child.

The little girl turned and back stepped into the curved tan colored wall with a giggle, sliding down and sat against the wall with a grin, wearing a peach colored tuxedo with a pink bowtie and two cheekbones of solid pink heart, extending both arms.

The mother of the Vee team slowly lowered and placed the twin babies into the arms of the three-year little girl. Then, the mother reached out and gently shoved the little two-year-old boy and the one-year-old little girl, sitting them on each side of the three-year-old little girl. She leaned down with a smile and a giggle, whispering a set of secret words, gently tapping on the nose bridge of each child.

Each child giggled with a grin and a nod.

The mother of the Vee team stood upright and stared down with a smile at her precious children, back stepping from the rear wall and her kids, swinging around with a sneer and a sour frown and stopped in front of the soft wall-to-wall and low and long beige colored bench.

Jackie twirled around in series of tight circles to see each screen with a smile and away from the sitting children on the entrance wall. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, each Vee team member must participate and accept the judgment. Thus, the Cee team has lost the justification case. Now, each Cee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of tan and the pretty color of red against the forward wall for justice. Each Cee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment, too. Thus, the Vee team is sentenced to death by means of the Cee team's fun and creative methods on the wall of criminals."

Jamie swirled around in a series of tight circle to see each glass screen with a smile and away from the sitting children on the entrance wall. "Vee team, please select your pleasure. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. Pick out whatever suites your heart and your hand. This part of Zulu Time is choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Cee team member must fire one weapon at one oval shaped object and kill the wiggling object on the forward wall. A Cee team member will know a kill shot has occurred when the oval shaped object has turned into the color of rich black, covering the tan or red tape. In this case, there is only one member of the Vee team, the mother of five cute children. The age of her children range, staring with the ages of three years old down to three months old, thus the children cannot hold or access or toss a deadly weapon at any member of the Cee team that is located on the front wall. And I do believe that our evening audience is filled with a set of parents that love and protect their children that symbolized the Vee team win for tonight."

The mother of the Vee team stood in front of the short bench and lowered a hand, slapping the soft fabric. The lid lifted into the air and revealed an array of weapons. She leaned down and selected two weapons, standing upright with a sneer at the front wall of criminals.

The four Cee team members wiggled a tan and red taped body side to side, sounding like a set of moaning ghosts.

The mother of the Vee team shifted one of the weapons into the other palm, reaching up and slapped the soft fabric. The beige lid dropped down in silence.

Jamie stopped the swirl and said to the wall of criminals. "There are too many objects on the forward wall. That is not a prob, thou. The single mother of the Vee team member holds a pair of automatic hand guns, standing in front of the first and largest oval shaped object. Thus, she must hit each object until the tan or red tape turns into the color of rich black for a kill shot. The other members of the Vee team are tiny children under the age of four years old. The rules of Zulu Time state that a child as young as four years old must aim and fire a weapon. However, all her children are younger than the age rule and are exempt from Zulu Time. And it is not against any of the Zulu Time rules, if the Vee team member holds and handles two more weapons with both hands. This justification case cannot be completed until all the objects have turned black death. And the team member will start with the largest object on the forward wall. A line of Regulators is required to assist the single member of the Vee team. Let's get outta of here, now, Jamie."

"I'm outta of here, now, Jackie." Jamie smiled at the wall of criminals too.

Then, the two females spun around with a smile and dashed into the dark archway.

A line of golden tinted Regulators entered the Zulu Time room from the Vee team doorway and split into two separate groups. One regulator stopped and stood beside the mother of the Vee team, giving a set of earplugs for the loud hand gun noise, clicking off the safety on each gun to fire and to kill the wall of criminals.

The second group of Regulators advanced to the entrance wall and stopped, bending down, placing a set of earplugs into each tiny eardrum into each tiny child and stood upright, spinning around in unison as one unit, exiting through the Cee team member door.

The solo Regulator back stepped from the mother of the Vee team and turned to the side, advancing back through the Vee team member door, disappearing into the darkness.

Jackie and Jaime appeared and stood inside each separate archway on the opposite wall for safety with a smile and a nod in unison. "Aim high..."

Both the doors closed down and shut.

The mother of the Vee team, she lifted and aimed the two hand guns with two fists, gritting her teeth, pressing the trigger finger on each weapon. A set of continuous array of bullets released and fired one at a time, sailing one at a time through the air waves, hitting the skull, the neck, the heart, and other body parts of the first and largest oval shaped object on the forward wall.

"Argh..." The voice of the female, the first and largest object on the wall of criminals briefed screamed with pain and as, the tan colored body jerked up, down, and sideways from an array of flying and killing bullets. Then, all the red and tan colored taped turned black on every single part of the dead body.

The mother of the Vee team halted her shooting with a gasp and shifted sideways, stopping in place, lifting and aimed both hand guns at the second object on the forward wall. The bullets fired into the tan and red colored tape.

"Waah," the voice of the mature daughter, the second object on the wall of criminals sounded with a scream and as, each limb jumped up, down, and sideways, hitting back against the wall. Then, the red and tan colored taped turned black as the second body on the wall of criminals shivered in death of stillness.

The mother of the Vee team, she halted the shooting and shifted sideways, standing in front of the last and third object on the forward wall, lifted and aimed the two hand guns, firing an array of flying and killing bullets. The bullets hit the skull, the heart, and the legs and one arm.

The third object on the wall of criminals wiggled side to side. "Pfft..." the soft voice of the last oval shape sounded and expired into death.

The Zulu Time room went black.

The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile in unison within the darkness. "It is done."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "I hoped that you have enjoyed the evening program, so far."

The voice of Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "The night is still young and fresh. Sit back and stay tuned for more Zulu Time!"

Each wall of glass inside a home within Society City Four changed into a set of wiggling lines of pink and purple with a musical song of soft flute classical music.

Inside the bedroom suite of Ucal on top of the mattress within Society City Two, he frowned down at the pink and purple wiggling com-d screen. "You should not mess with a mother of sweet children."

Inside the Zulu Time room and on each black colored wall of glass inside each home within Society Four City and on the single com-d of Ucal, the voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile in unison within the darkness, "Welcome to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!"

Then, the smiling face of both girls appeared on each wall of glass and the tiny com-d screen of Ucal. A new song of trumpets and piano jazzy musical notes and an array of colorful fireworks flamed over both the collar bones of both Jackie and Jaime within the blazing colorful background.

The overhead lights illuminated inside on each wall of glass.

The Zulu Time room was fashioned into a D-shape with one continuous wall and a straight forward wall. The curved wall was colored in tan, without a single art painting or a viewing window of the trees or a peak of bright sunlight. The forward wall was long and straight, holding emptiness.

A set of two doors on the curved wall slid upward and opened, showing two females.

Jackie strolled and exited from one of two open side doors. Then Jaime strolled and exited from the second open side door. Both the females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the tan colored room with a smile and a nod. Each female turned and rotated in a series of tight circles, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jaime and Jackie Jones."

Jackie wore the same dress and the facial designs, twirling around in the same spot with a smile, holding the microphone to her lips, seeing each tiny glass screen. "Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of just and justice."

Jaime wore the same dress and the same facial designs, spinning around in the same spot with a smile, holding the microphone near her lips to see all the tiny glass screens on the curved wall. "I am Jaime. I will explain all the rules for any new audience viewers. Each party is allowed to voice their justification case within a twenty-second time period in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your suppertime meal. After twenty seconds has ended, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for the criminal or the letter of V for the victim."

Then, each female swung around with a smile and moved back toward a closed door on the opposite wall.

The Cee team doorway slid open first.

Jaime swung around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of four people in front of a low and long bench of soft fabric within the Zulu Time room and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of sneers, finger pointing on the other side of the room, wearing the same long evening gowns and tuxedos in the color of white. Each face was decorated with the letter X that was displayed in a series of individual symbols over the two cheekbones, a chin, and a forehead in the color of deep maroon hue.

The Vee team doorway slid open next.

Jackie spun around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of three people in front of the same low bench of soft beige fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and turned with a sigh of worry, scanning the rear wall, where all criminals would be posted and killed by the firepower of the winning team of Zulu Time. The Vee team members wore a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of electric blue color. Each face was decorated in a set of large silver tinted bells.

Jamie and Jackie spun around and met in middle with a smile and a nod, twirling with a hand wave to see each glass screen.

Jackie stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of blazing electric blue. My twin sister Jamie stands behind the Cee team. The Vee team claims that the teenage of the Cee team continues to paint his name over and over again on the exterior beige paint of each one of their business buildings that are owned by the Vee team members. The Vee team members must repaint the building and have kindly asked that the family members of the Cee team stop. But the verbal request has not been honored. Thus, this is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team."

Inside the bedroom suite of Ucal on top of the mattress within Society City Two, he frowned with a nod down at the com-d screen. "Yeah, I've seen the pretty graffiti of faces and names on all these buildings too. It is a pity that the teen didn't heed the wise advice."

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jamie stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone. "I am Jaime. I stand behind the Cee team of pure white. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence. This action is not allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty seconds of time. Since, each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jackie reached out and handed the microphone to the middle aged adult female of the Vee team with a smile. Her twin sister, Jamie extended an arm and handed her microphone to a middle aged male of the Cee team. They both back stepped from the bench and the two debating teams, sliding into an empty space on the wall and said in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The middle aged female of the Vee team wore an electric blue gown with a matching pair of elbow gloves and a face of single silver tinted bells, accepting the microphone, standing in silence without speaking.

The middle aged father of the Cee team accepted the microphone and lifted it up into the lips with a sneer, wearing a white colored tuxedo and a pair of green colored gloves with a matching bowtie of green. His face was painted with the letter X that crunched when he talked. "My son didn't do that. I take care of my son. I watch my son and my daughter. You are nothing but rich and spoiled with your fancy clothes and your fancy hover cars and your fancy buildings..."

"Yes, I admit that we are rich." The middle aged female of the Vee team nodded with a smile at the father of the Cee team and as her face painted silver bells soft tinged into her eardrums.

"Yeah, yeah, then a little paint won't hurt your fancy buildings."

The middle aged female woman of the Vee team nodded with a stern face to the father of the Cee team and her face painted silver bells softly tinged into her eardrums. "I and my sister have kindly asked you to cease and to halt the spray painting on each one of our buildings. You have not stopped with our kind and numerous verbal requests, sir."

The father of the Cee team sneered. "My son didn't do it. He didn't do it."

The teenage son of the Cee team moved ahead and stood beside his father with a sneer at the elderly woman, wearing a white colored tuxedo and a pair of green colored gloves with a matching bowtie of green. His face was painted with the letter X that crunched when the teen grinded the teeth.

The father of the Cee wrapped an arm around his son with a nod and a smile. "I believe my son. My son says that he didn't do. You can't prove nothing, bitch number one and bitch number two."

The middle aged woman of the Vee team frowned at the father of the Cee team and as her face paint of silver bells tinged into the eardrums. "Is your son named Airme?"

The father of the Cee team nodded with a smile and slapped the collar bone of his son with a nod. "Yeah, my son is named Airme. That's his name. What of it, bitch number one?"

"Airme is written all over each building, sir." The middle aged woman of the Vee team grinned and as her face paint of silver bells tinged into the eardrums.

The father of the Cee team and the teen male gasped with shock.

The Zulu Time room went dark.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The deadline of twenty seconds has expired."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only."

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness, "If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl."

Inside the bedroom suite of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he laughed with a nod, pressing the button on the com-d for the judgment inside Zulu Time. "Yeah, I saw the name Airme on each building, too. Airme should have used another proper name for the crime. Now, he is going to do the time in hell," laughing.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness and stared at each black tinted screen. "The voting is finished."

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness and stared at each black tinted glass screen. "Please illuminate all the glass screens now inside Zulu Time."

All the tiny glass screens showed a black background with one single letter in white.

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "I am not surprised, Jackie."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "I am not, either, Jamie."

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The highest mathematical number wins the justification case. The highest number of letter is V for the victim team."

The tiny glass screens turned back into black. The dark room echoed in a series of loud screams and harsh curses plus the sounds of soft rips and tears of fabric. Then, the room was silent.

A few minutes later, all the lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room.

On the forward wall, there were four objects. They stood in height from the tallest down to the shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages, coming from the hair roots down to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

In front of the continuous low sitting bench of soft fabric colored that was mounted from wall-to-wall, the Vee team stood in place in a row of three persons in silence.

The first person of the Vee team, the middle aged woman smirked and slapped the soft beige fabric on top of the long bench. The lid slowly and silently lifted upward into the air waves.

Jackie swirled in place with a smile at each tiny glass screen. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, each Vee team member must participate and accept the judgment. Thus, the Cee team has lost the justification case. Now, each Cee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of beige and the color of red against the forward wall for just and justice. Each Cee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment, too. Thus, the Cee team is sentenced to death by means of the Vee team."

Jamie twirled in place beside her sister along the wall with a smile at each glass screen. "Vee team, please select your weapon. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. Pick out, whatever. This part of Zulu Time is the choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Vee team member must discharge one weapon at one time and hit any part of the live or dead body. And I do believe that our evening audience is filled with the same emotion, seeing the same ugly graffiti on the buildings, siding with the Vee team members."

The three Vee team members stood in a row and stared down into the cabinet of the bench without whispers or a team huddle. The middle aged woman reached down and slapped the fabric. The bench lid lifted upright. Each member of the Vee team reached down and selected a weapon inside the lighted cabinet, holding the items between the arms.

The middle aged woman turned and moved, standing in front of the first and largest objecto on the wall of criminals.

Jamie stopped the whirl and smiled at the wall of criminals. "There are three members of the Vee team and four members of Cee team. So, each member of Vee team is standing in front of an object on the forward wall, holding a weapon in both their hands."

Jackie stopped the whirl and smiled at the wall of criminals. "We need to leave the Zulu Time room, Jamie. The Regulators are not required within this Zulu Time activity."

Then, each female spun around with a smile and dashed toward the open archway on the opposite side of the curvy tan colored wall of tiny glass screens.

Jackie and Jaime entered and swung around, standing inside a separate archway and out of the way, saying in unison with a smile. "Aim high." They back stepped and moved into the dark tunnel for safety and protection.

Then, both the doors closed down shut and tight.

The first member of the Vee team, a middle aged woman wore an ankle-length gown of electric blue, a pair of matching elbow gloves, and a face of silver bells that tinged in musical tones when she sneered. She held a large pick axe with a triangular tip, lifting both arms into the air and over her hair roots, rearing back the weapon and pitched it forward with a heavy grunt. The weapon flew through the air end over end and sliced into the red colored tape of the chest cavity which was the heart region on the first object on the forward wall.

"Pfft..." The voice of male, the first object on the wall of criminals exhaled a final breath of life and as, the red colored tape burned into rich black of death.

The first member of the Vee team, the middle aged woman shuffled to the side and reached down, grabbing a second pike axe and stood in front of the second object on the forward wall. She held a large pick axe with a triangular tip, lifting both arms into the air and over her hair roots, rearing back the weapon and pitched it forward with a set of gritted teeth and a heavy grunt at the second object on the forward wall. The pike axe flew through the air end over end and sliced into the red colored tape of the chest cavity which was the heart region on the second object on the forward wall.

"Pfft..." The voice of female, the second object on the wall of criminals exhaled the last breath of life and as, the red colored tape burned into rich black of death.

The first member of the Vee team, the middle aged woman turned with a smirk and nodded to the second member of the Vee team, her middle aged sister.

The second member of the Vee team, the middle aged sister wore an electric blue gown and stood in place in a pair of jeweled electric blue sandals, parting her feet inside the ankle-length electric blue gown, gritting the teeth and tossed a nasty-looking long spear with a spiked tip at the third object on the forward wall. The spear hit and stuck directly into red colored tape which was the left eyeball of face on the third object on the forward wall.

"Uoo..." The voice of the teen male, the third object on the wall of criminals screamed out in pain and wiggled side to side in pain of the impact and as, the red colored tape turned into rich black hue. The body slapped all limbs against the back wall of tan and stilled in death.

The second Vee team member, the middle aged sister turned with a smirk and a nod to see the third member of the Vee team, her elderly father.

The third member of the Vee team, the elderly father didn't bother to view his daughter, wearing an electric blue tuxedo with a pair of red gloves and a matching bowtie, lifting with a shaky hand a short club with a set of spikes throughout the wood near a jaw line with gray whiskers. He stood in front of the fourth object on the forward wall.

Inside the bedroom suite of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he smiled down at the com-d. "Wow! That is so cool, another new weapon, a spiked short throwing club. The Regulators have been busy this week," laughing.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the third member of the Vee team, the elderly father tossed the short club toward the fourth object on the forward wall. The club didn't arch up enough into the ceiling and descend down toward the floor, landing with a soft thud in the middle of the tan colored carpet. He exhaled with a huff of annoyance and reached down, grabbing a second short club with a set of spiky points over the wood and lifted near his jaw line, tossing it through the air. The weapon flew across the floor and arched downward, dropping down and fell over the carpet for a second time with a soft thud. The elderly father exhaled with a huff of annoyance and reached down, grabbing a third short club with a shaky hand, quickly pitched it away from the jaw line through the air waves.

His two middle aged daughters turned and wring both hands with a worried brow and a worried heart, watching their father toss away three of the Zulu Time weapons. Their biological elderly father had to hit and kill the fourth object on the wall of criminals inside the Zulu Time room as a separate and independent member of the winning Vee team.

The third member of the Vee team, the elderly father exhaled with a huff of disappointment and reached down, grabbing a fourth short club with a shaky hand, lifting it even with his jaw line of gray whiskers, pitching the weapon through the air waves.

Inside the bedroom suite of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he frowned down at the com-d. "Geez, that's not cool! The old man is having trouble with the short spiked clubs. I don't think that he has the arm strength to make it to the far, far wall of the criminals. And he needs to do that or else something bad will happen to the entire Vee team that win the Zulu Time event."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the third member of the Vee team, the elderly father lifted the arm and reared back the elbow, pitching the short club toward the fourth object on the forward wall. The short club sailed through the air with speed and stuck into the tan colored tape which was the right leg of the fourth object on the forward wall.

"Ooo..." A voice of young male, the fourth object on the wall of criminals screamed in pain into the empty room and as, the tan colored tape on the leg did not turn into a hue of red blood or rich black. The fourth object wiggled side to side in pain and moaned like a ghost inside the quiet room.

The third member of the Vee team, the elderly father turned with a smile and held two thumbs up to see both his middle aged daughters.

The two daughters gasped and wring both hands in worry.

Inside the bedroom suite of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he gasped down at the com-d. "No, no, old man! You need to kill the last and fourth criminal the wall. You only used the short club with the spikes to slam and stuck into the right leg. Geez! This is not good."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the voices of Jackie and Jamie shouted with a stern face inside the Zulu Time room. "Stop, now. Silence, now."

Both side walls opened and revealed the twins Jackie and Jamie. Each one moved ahead and lifted both arms in the air with a stern face and twirled around in a circle to see each glass screen.

Jackie continued to twirl and smile into each glass screen. "O no! There is a new issue with the Zulu Time."

Jamie continued to twirl and smile into each glass screen. "O no, too! But Zulu Time has a solution."

The first middle aged daughter spun around with a sour frown to see the twirling circles of the twins. "What is happening here? What are you talking about? What is the new issue?"

The second middle aged daughter spun around with a sour frown to see the twirling circles of the twins. "Stop twirling! Tell us what to do next? I don't understand your statement."

The third member of the Vee team, the elderly father continued to smile and held two thumbs up, seeing the nose profile of his middle aged daughters.

Jackie stopped the twirl and stood in place, dropping both arms with a stern face and a serious tone to the members of the Vee team and as her voice echoed through the Zulu Time room. "Stop, now. Silence, now."

Jaime stopped the twirl and stood in place, dropping both arms with a stern face and a serious tone to each member of the Vee team. "When a member of the original team member does not kill in black hue the assigned object on the wall of criminals, the entire winning team becomes the new set of criminals."

"Criminals..." Jaime twirled around in the pretty dress with a smile at each glass screen.

"Criminals..." Jackie swirled in the opposite direction beside her sister in the pretty dress with a smile at each glass screen also.

The middle aged daughter lifted and jabbed an electric blue colored gloved finger with a sneer at Jackie and Jamie. "Now, you listen here to me! I am very rich and..."

The room went dark. Then the dark room echoed in a series of screams and curses plus the sounds of rips and tears of fabric. Then, the room was silence.

A few second later, the overhead lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room.

On the forward wall, there was a set of seven objects that stood in various heights. The first four objects represented the Cee team members from tallest down towards shortest, where first three objects continued to bleed in the hue of rich black.

The fourth object of tan and red colored taped continued to wiggle side to side, moaning like a ghost inside the quiet room.

A second group of wiggling objects of tan and red colored tape represented the three member of the Vee team from tallest down towards shortest. The newest three objects were taped in the color of tan bandages from the hair roots down to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

Jackie stood behind the row of Regulators and twirled in a complete circle to see each screen with a smile. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, each Vee team member had participated and had accepted the final judgment. Thus, the Cee team had lost the justification case. Then, each Cee team member had been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of beige and the pretty color of red against the forward wall for justice. Each Cee team member had seen, felt, heard, and tasted their upcoming death, but one. The fourth member of the Cee team is still alive and well on the wall of criminals."

Jackie stood behind the row of Regulators and twirled in a complete circle to see each screen with a smile. "Then, each Vee team had selected a weapon based on the heart and the desires. This part of Zulu Time had been the choice and the freedom of winning team. The only rule, each Vee team member had to discharge one or more weapons for the ultimate death kill. Thus, each Vee team member had to completely kill the assigned criminal on the wall. When a team member fails to kill the assigned target on the wall of criminals, the entire Vee team is sentenced to death by means of the Zulu Time rules and the row of Regulators. Please come out, Regulators."

Two individual lines of Regulators emerged from each side of the open archway on the curved wall, carrying a hand gun and stopped, standing in a straight row in front of the low and long bench. Each Regulator dropped the weapon even with the floor and cocked back the slide.

"Time to leave, Jackie." Jamie spun around and dashed into the open darkness with a smile.

"Twirling out of the way, too, Jamie," Jackie swung around and dashed with a smile into the other open darkness along the curved wall.

Then both doors slammed down and closed shut.

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he frowned down at the com-d. "O no! I told you so."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the trigger finger was pressed as an array of bullets fired from each hand gun of each Regulator in front of the bench. The four objects of alive and well warm bodies on the wall of criminals wiggled side to side from the massive number of flying bullets, flinging up both arms and legs and then the body slammed back down each limbs over the back wall in stillness of death, without a single sound.

Both doors slid upward and opened.

The single row of Regulators swung around to face an open door and split in half, marching ahead and entered the darkness of the Zulu Time hallway in silence.

Jackie and Jaime advanced forward, stopped, and stood with a smile inside the open archway, saying in unison. "It is done."

Jackie smiled. "Thank you for visiting Zulu Time. I hoped that you have enjoyed the evening program."

Jamie smiled. "Good night from Jaime and Jackie Jones until tomorrow night."

The room went black.

Inside the private bedroom of Ucal on top of the bed mattress within Society City Two, he frowned down at the com-d. "Stupid Vee team members, did you bother to read the instructions on the com-d before accepting an invite into the Zulu Time room? Each person has to kill one tan and red object on the wall of criminals. Or you become the wall of dead criminals."

He leaned over and rested the com-d on top of the nightstand with a smile. "Goodnight, Igala! I promise that we will have fun, together, tomorrow night at the next Society City." He flipped over and rested a chin over the soft pillow, not sleeping with a deep sigh of disappointment and frustration. He softly sneered. "Dfee..."

286th day of the current year

Society City Two

05:05 am (early morning)

Hot temperatures with dull sunrise of pink, yellow, and blue

Private suite of Igala

Entrance door setting

The sound of a hand knock echoed throughout the suite.

I rushed forward from the sitting room toward the door with a smile and stopped, standing in place with a yawn from my last night with Dfee. Currently, I wore an elegant gown of dull solid pink with a set of long sleeves and an open back spine panel, feeling the cool air conditioning wind inside the room over my exposed skin. The long dress train flowed down and over three feet from my butthole, making me like a fairy tale princess for the day.

I reached up and slapped the metal with a grin and a giggle.

The door slid upward and opened to reveal the cute and hunky teen male.

Ucal stood in front of the archway with a nod and a smile to her. "Good morn, Igala! You look so pretty like a princess in that beautiful gown."

I giggled with a set of teenly hormones, hearing his tender words of charm. "I feel like a princess, my prince."

He extended an arm to her and wiggled his eyebrows for fun. I reached out and grabbed the arm, stepping forward and cuddled into his chest with a grin and a giggle.

They spun around and moved ahead down an empty hallway with a set of tiny bits of loose swirling sand particles and a light windy breeze without a set of golden Regulator guards or a pair of bald headed and pale colored sea people.

The dress hem dragged behind her butthole and as, she reached down, gathering a handful of the silk fabric, jerking the train forward. The dress obeyed as I giggled with a smile.

They turned to the side and slowly advanced down the circular staircase as a young couple.

Ucal continued to cuddle and patted her naked hand with a smile. "How did you sleep?"

"Fine," I cleared a throat with a smirk. "I had a good time, yesterday afternoon."

He moved around and around inside the circular staircase, staring down with a stern face at each step. "I'm surprised. I wasn't much company after the lunch." Ucal wasn't happy that the sea people didn't listen to the speech about Zulu Time and didn't bother to ask questions. This was the second Society City on the Tour of Zulu Time which felt like a disappointment, also.

Ucal had mentioned the tart outcome of the land peopled to his mom. She shrugged a shoulder and advised him to carry on with the Tour of Zulu Time. He loved and accepted the warm hug and the good advice from his mom, arriving within Society City Two with a set of high hopes.

The only hope was some private time with Igala which also had turned into bigger disappointment when his childhood friend Dfee stole Igala from her private chamber room inside the Sea Hotel.

"I meant that I had enjoyed walking over the shallow warm water on the sea that made my feet feel funny. The water was part water and part salt."

"I meant that we can come and visit the sea, again, after we wed and before we start our new re-gen jobs."

"Yeah, we can do that, too." I landed on the ground floor with a smile and stared out at the clean glass doors of the closed archway to see the black tinted airship limousine that was parked over the colored sands. Ucal was talking about marriage to her. Dfee was talking about marriage to her, too. I had not decided upon which teen that I liked best in regard to marriage, but I continued to ponder with a smile and a giggle.

Inside the lobby setting, Ucal and I strolled forward and moved through the empty corridor with the loose colorful sand particles and the array of clean glass windows of a bright sunny day.

I turned and smiled at the empty lobby of the Sea Castle, making a new memory within my neurons. "What Society City are we visiting next, this morning?"

"Society City Five," He patted the arm of Igala and moved ahead toward the limousine without seeing the clean windows or the pretty day with a stern frown.

I frowned with the same task of the same tour. "How many Society Cities are there? I forget to ask."

"There are eighteen."

I gasped. "Eighteen? If we visit a city a day or two, then we will be gone from Hall for eighteen to twenty-six or thirty or more days. I'll miss tons of Hall classes."

He leaned over and smiled into her cheekbone with his secret. "Yeah, it'll be fun to miss Hall. I don't miss Hall. I don't miss my parents, either. But I do enjoy being with you, Igala." Ucal seemed to be in a better mood from yesterday afternoon, after being rejected by the sea people.

They stopped and watched the sliding glass doors open, moving through the open archway toward the limousine in silence among the hot temperatures with a dull sunrise.

I stopped in front of the open door of the limousine and released his hand, stooping down and slid over the bench seat with a smile, bouncing up and down on top of the soft leather, staring at his nose profile. I had too much fun with Dfee, yesterday afternoon. I ruined the evening black sequined re-designer evening gown too, leaving it inside my personal sleeping suite and on the floor of the dirty bathroom. It was my dress to own and wear. I selected not to wear it, anymore. One of the nice cleaning staff members could steal it for fun. And I didn't mind, either.

Dfee was too much fun during the water play.

I dreamt of Dfee last night during my restful sleep, saying with a smile to Ucal. "I love the beach here within Society City Two. Were you able to enjoy the water, yesterday? It was very warm and very salty and very..."

He turned and smiled at her. "I have been here before."

"Really, when?"

"Numerous times, the Regulator training requires a visitation to the other cities during the selection process."

I faked a smile. I really didn't want to hear about a job with the Regulator gang, again. "O. That's nice. Did you enjoy the sea water? Did you swim in the water, too?"

"Yeah, as a kid..."

I faked a smile, feeling the tension between us grow higher and faster. "Wow, that's grand. As a kid, I played inside the dirt hills with the horses and underneath the cool tree shades, pretending to be a princess."

He stared into her eyeballs. He had eye witnessed both Dfee and Igala as a couple on the colorful sandy beach, turning away from the hidden camera before it became too intimate within his eyeballs and his guts.

Dfee and Igala didn't know that the satellite tracking system was following them and their kisses. Well, Dfee probably did, since he was a very smart-hole teenager.

Ucal wasn't really angry, only jealous. He had selected Igala years ago during one of the electronic academic sessions on the com-d at his house at the age of thirteen years old. Of course, a pre-teen didn't attend Hall with a gang of boys or girls. However, he did see Igala at the horse ranch of his grandparents. She was pretty and smart and unattached, without a boy best, which was a silly name for a boyfriend.

Ucal met Igala on the first day of their shared school Hall, falling instantly in love. He had decided that she was the one. At the age of eighteen years, a couple could marry and start a new life, living and moving away from twin set of biological parents. He was concerned about her survival skills as a Regulator, but she had performed exceptionally and elegantly within the Bowl competition, that was part of Zulu Time. Thus, she and he would be able to follow into the foot prints of his parents with ease as a new pair of Regulators.

He smiled with a nod. "The Regulator program wants to recruit members all the time. The life of a Regulator is pretty short..."

I gasped. "Do they die? I didn't get that impression. I thought only the family of losers of the Zulu Time died. Why is it so short? I didn't know that."

He smiled. "They retire, not die at a young age. It is a healthy career choice."

"O. That's interesting. Does the gold retire with them?" I giggled.

"What?" He frowned.

I dropped my smile and my wit. "O. That's interesting."

"It is a perk of being a Regulator kid. Actually, my parents along with some others are getting ready to retire. So the Regulator unit needs new recruits, fresh blood, and young muscle," he chuckled.

I stared with a blank face into his violet colored eyeballs. Ucal was talking about the Regulator duties, again. I found the job to be creepy and scary and dangerous. I didn't understand why a person would choose to be a Regulator over a re-designer of eating dishes. I giggled. "So, where are we going to attend first, this too early morn?" I yawned and slapped a hand over the ugly tongue. Then I dropped the hand down into the lap of silky fabric and bounced with excitement up and down on top of the smooth leather with a grin, sliding over and banged a nose bridge into the clean and shiny window, staring out at the waves of blue water and the colorful flat sandy beach. I was trying to locate the particular sandbar where Dfee and I had a lot of kissing fun, yesterday afternoon. "We are going to Society City Five. So, where is Society City Five? I'm having so much fun, learning about the region. Do we pass through Dead Man's Land, again?"

The com-d sounded with a tiny ding. Ucal heard the sound and looked down to see the message on the screen with a smile, "O yeah, Dead Man's Land."

The limousine lifted up from the sand and over the rooftop of the hotel and the other buildings, slowly flying in a western direction back toward the edge of the city limits of the beach town of Society City Two. I could feel the rumble of the warm engines underneath the pair of new re-designer spiked heel sandals without burning off my naked toes and as, my stomach swayed side to side with the air bumps within the sky. I could not find the sandbar where Dfee and I had used in the late afternoon until darkness. The sea waves were rough this morning. All the sandbars were covered in blue-greenish sea water. I continued to view the beautiful scene of the colored sands and sea water, thinking about the lovely time yesterday with a grin and a soft giggle of delight.

The limousine accelerated to one hundred miles per hour, soaring over the air waves and through the white clouds. Then the miles of blue ocean water and colored sands disappeared into the orange mist of clouds that drifted over the landscape of Dead Man's Land.

I continued to lean into the cool glass window and as, my peripheral vision could see only orange mist. The limousine flew from the landscape of the pretty beach, over the air space, and above the deep canyon of Dead Man's Land.

Society City Four was shaped like an oval island and surrounded by a very deep red and green colored canyon. The canyon went around and around Society City Four at each geographical direction which was called Dead Man's Land.

I continued to smear the clean window with my fresh breath, pressing both sweaty hands onto the glass, feeling the cool air from the outside white clouds. The window was bombarded with an array of tiny water droplets from the clouds, too. The white clouds had parted and revealed the landmass down inside the canyon which was way, way down there from the air.

The limousine was crossing over Dead Man's Land location and halted in front of the pair of steel gates among the orange fog with hot temperatures and bright sunray.

I could not see through the thick orange fog the set of tiny objects on the ground level below which did contain tiny trees within the tiny forests, rows of tiny crops, and the tiny dried red mud houses. Dean Man's Land existed down there all alone and isolated from any of the other Society Cities. The only way down was inside a hover car, but the Regulator would not allow a pilot to do that.

The limousine reduced speed, slowed, and halted into a stop within the air in front of a pair of twin steel gates.

I continued to stare and bad breath onto my side window inside the limousine, and as my eyeballs could see the row of standing Regulators in front of the gates.

The limousine floated within the air waves over Dead Man's Land which was located on the outer perimeter or outskirts of Society City Four. No one came out this far without being detected and monitored and then arrested by a Regulator.

The see-through wall of steel rods of each steel gate displayed a set of numerous hollow holes where each beam bar zigged and zagged and crossed within the gate pattern. I can see through the naked beam pattern with a pair of naked eyeballs. However, I or my air vehicle could not drive through the steel gates of numerous beams unless I had received permission from the Regulators.

The window of the driver dropped down. The Regulator stepped forward and leaned down to listen in silence to the driver of the airship limousine and then nodded with a set of secret words back to the driver. The limousine window rolled back up. The Regulator stepped back and nodded with a golden tinted skull to one of the Regulators.

The center Regulator held a palm-sized device inside the hand and pressed a button. Then, the entire row of Regulators parted and separated into two groups, sliding sideways from the center of the twin steel gates.

The steel gate slowed parted and separated into two solid sections, opening into a pair of two separate gates in the outward direction and safely away from the row of Regulators and the grill of the hovering airship limousine. The two separate gates slowed and then halted in the air waves and above the deep canyon.

The limousine slowed flew forward through the air waves of the opened gates.

The grill of limousine slowly emerged over the land of flat red dirt with a set of scattered tree groves within Society City Four. The view of the Dead Man's Land slowly disappeared from the side windows of the vehicle.

The limousine sailed through the open steel gates and emerged back into the clear air space of Society City Four. The vehicle sailed over the tree tops of the yellow and green meadows and headed toward the eastern direction, making the ground scenery a blurry film of red, green, yellow, and orange colors, moving at hundred miles per hour.

The sunlight was blinding to the eyeballs, coming up from the early eastern horizon.

"Ugh, the blurry landscape makes my eyeballs dizzy. And the blinding sunlight makes my head spin." I shaded both eyeballs and leaned back into the seat with a stern face. "We are heading east. So, I would guess that Society City Five is located on the eastern side of our home town of Society City Four."

Ucal continued to stare down with a smile at the com-d. "Yeah, we travel at one hundred miles per hour."

I reached down and slapped the soft leather of the bench seating with a giggle and a grin. "Wow, I don't feel it."

Society City Four

Eastern geographical direction

Steel gates entrance setting

Warm temperatures with bright sunrise of red and pink

The limousine slowed speed and dropped down from the clear skyline, halting into a stop in front of a pair of closed steel gates at the eastern end of the Society City Four. The steel gates were crisscrossed with lines of metal like the previous three pairs, keeping an airship inside Society City Four without passing into the next Society City.

The driver lowered the window and thumbed the rear seat of the limousine with a set of secret words. The Regulator stepped forward from the line of buddies and leaned a golden head down into the open window of the driver with a whisper and a bland face, listening to the explanation and stood upright, pointing toward the center Regulator. The limousine window rolled back up. The Regulator stepped back and nodded with a golden tinted skull to one of the Regulators.

The center Regulator held a palm-sized device inside the hand and pressed a button. Then, the entire row of Regulators parted and separated into two groups, sliding sideways from the center of the twin steel gates.

The steel gates parted with a set of squealing noise.

I turned and leaned into the side window with a gasp to see the Regulator and the part of the long steel gates. "I heard that squealing noise, again."

"I mentioned before that the steel gates are kinda rusty." Ucal continued to type on the com-d with a stern face.

The steel gate slowed parted and separated into two solid sections, opening into a pair of two separate gates in an outward direction and safely away from the row of Regulators and the grill of the hovering airship limousine.

The two separate gates slowed and then halted in the air waves and above the deep canyon.

The limousine slowed flew forward through the air waves of the opened gates. The grill of limousine slowly emerged over empty air waves and the deep canyon of Dead Man's Land

Dead Man's Land

Eastern setting

Cold temperatures with dull sunrise of orange and green

I could see more tiny objects on the ground level, making out the designs of tiny trees within the tiny forests, rows of tiny crops, and the tiny dried red mud houses like the three other geographical canyon views of Dean Man's Land which existed alone and isolated from any of the other Society Cities. I continued to stare into the window and down into the canyon with a confused brow. "Why would someone leave our hometown? Okay, that is a stupid question..."

"That is not a stupid question. That is a valid question. And the answer is no one. The steel gates are ancient and rusty, since they are not opened until there is an authority figure to open the gates."

"You..."

"Us..."

I smiled down the deep canyon, "Me and you are an authority figure here in front of the steel gates."

"Me and you are on a traveling show for the Tour of Zulu Time."

I frowned. "But, so far, no one cares to hear about Zulu Time..."

"Not true!" He turned and growled at her face.

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance. "Alright, no one seemed to understand the concept of Zulu Time. I don't see any type of glass walls for an entertainment program..."

"This is our purpose for the Tour of Zulu Time."

I giggled with a smile. "Is that pronounced with a capital T and a capital Z?"

He frowned. "What?"

The squeaky steel gates halted in the air. The limousine slowly moved through the air waves over the deep canyon.

I turned with a grin and leaned into the window, staring down at the landscape. "It is another deep canyon of green colors and tan colors and red colors and black colors."

"Dead Man's Land is an oval shaped deep canyon."

"Can an air ship land down there with the crew dying some terrible, horrible death?

"Maybe, I have never tried. I don't know of any citizen that has tried that feat and survived to tell about it."

"What's down there?"

"I don't really know."

"Does someone really know?"

"Dfee."

I turned and gasped at the rear strawberry blonde colored skull of Ucal. He leaned against the window and stared down at the landscape too. I frowned. "Dfee has been down to Dead Man's Land? I thought it was against the law for a citizen to exit the steel gates and leave Society City Four. I mean, Dfee is alive and well..."

He spun around with a smiling face and a body to see Igala. "Well, Dfee is alive. And it is against the law for any citizen to exit through the steel gates at any time."

I looked down with a gasp and a worried brow to see the wrinkles in my dress, whispering for my eardrums only. "Dfee left Society City Four and has met me, twice already. How did he do that? Why did he do that? He could get into very serious trouble." I shook my curls with worry and then smiled down at the dress. "But then, his childhood friend Ucal will come to the rescue."

"...looked bad. This is the reason for a pair of Regulators both night and day."

I looked up with a fake smile without hearing the rest of his words to see the smile on Ucal. "Well, we just visited the beach at Society City Two. The beach and water were so beautiful. Are citizens allowed to visit there for fun?"

"Naw."

"Why not?"

"One, the sea people do not want you to visit inside their Society City. Two, the Regulators will not allow you to leave our fair Society City. Three, if you try, then you die."

I gasped with a frown. "Did you just make that up, Ucal?"

He laughed with a nod. "Yeah, I did."

The limousine swiftly increased speed over the new landmass.

I swung around with a gasp to see landscape of Society City Five.

Society City Five location

05:10 am (early morning time zone)

Cold temperatures. Blue sky. White clouds

Flat rock pink tinted ground setting

The limousine emerged over a flat plot of land that was covered in hard rock of pink tint.

I turned and stared at the window with a gasp and a smile. "Look at the new landscape! It is nothing but miles and miles of pink colored rock. Hard looking rock. Wow, I don't see one single brown tree or a piece of green plant or a blade of green grass or a pretty flower. Does anything live inside a rock?"

"Something lives in there. I promise." He turned and smiled out his side window.

"This is a strange place."

"This is Society City Five."

The limousine slowed and dropped down from the air, landing on top of hard rock. The driver moved out from the seat and turned, stopping and stood, opening the rear door of the vehicle for Igala only.

I slid out and landed a pair of new re-designer sandals on top of the pink tinted stone with a gasp, gathering the long hem of the pink tinted dress and moved ahead, crunching the spiked heels of the sandals over more pink tinted stone. "What is the place? I see pink colored flat stone. The stone is beautiful and smooth. I have never seen soil like this." I looked up with a smile to see nature, "Blue sky, yellow sun, white clouds, red birds, no brown trees, no green bushes and miles of flat pink stone." I turned and gasped at the rest of the landscape. "Where is the building? I don't see a physical building. Where are the citizens? I don't see one citizen to meet and greet us. Are we in the wrong spot? Where are we located?"

"We are on top of Society City Five." Ucal slid out from the opposite side of the limousine, moving around the rear bumper of the vehicle and stopped, standing next to her nose profile with a smile. "There is not a building but a place. There are numerous citizens there, too. We are located in the right spot. Turn to the side and follow the horizon of the early morning." He reached out and gently grabbed her hand, swinging around, following the eastern sunrise.

I followed behind the back spine of Ucal and lifted, shading the eyeballs from the bright sunrays with a free hand and a gasp. "There is not a building or a row of buildings ahead of us. There is not a grove of tall trees or a set of scattered batches of short plants, only a ground plot of flat and pink tinted rock behind the rear bumper of the limo. There is only the flat pink colored stone over the landscape and below my feet and ahead of the limo also."

"It is called sandstone, actually. Watch me!" He released her hand with a chuckle and moved forward with a grin, advancing toward the edge of the cliff.

I stood in place and tossed an arm with a yell. "Wait, Ucal! There's nothing at the end of the cliff but the cliff. You're going to fall off and down the canyon and then get injured or worse die on me. The blinding sun is making it hard for me to see anything but the sunlight. Stop, Ucal! Wait for me!"

Ucal advanced toward the edge of the cliff and then disappeared, falling down into the rock.

"No." I screamed and lifted up the hem of the dress, dashing forward with a worried heart and stopped, standing in front of a large square shaped hole deep down inside the pink tinted rock with a gasp and a worried brow.

The strawberry blonde hair roots of Ucal slowly lifted up from the depths of the pink rock first and then the rest of his tall body. He stood in place on the first step with a chuckle and a grin to see Igala in silence.

I dropped the front of my gown skirt and reached over, slapping his chest with a lady sneer. "You scared me."

"I scared me, too. I almost missed the entrance way. Then it is a long way down."

I frowned, "What entrance way?"

He smiled with a nod, stomping a boot sole over the lowered piece of smooth and level rock. "I'm standing on top of the entranceway of Society City Five."

I looked down to see his boot toes on top of a broken piece of level pink rock. "I don't understand."

"Lift up your dress. Unless, you want me to do it?" He winked with a chuckle.

"No, I will do it." I reached down with a puzzled brow and grabbed the edge of the long dress, seeing the deep square shaped open hole with a gasp. The hole was very wide across the flat rock toward the end of the cliff and it was very deep, going down into the darkness of the ground. "What is that?"

He reached out and grabbed both her arms with a smile. "This is the first step of the entranceway down, not up into Society City Five. Hold you dress up! I don't want you to tumble down."

I gasped with worry. "Tumble down into where?"

"Society City Five," He moved backward and stomped on top of a second step with a smile. "This is the second step of a downward posed rock-covered staircase. Each step is very wide and very long, so no person gets hurt."

I did not move with an open mouth. "No, I don't wanna go down into a hole."

"The hole is the home of Society City Five."

"No, I don't like holes. I like dirt. I like sun. I like rain. I like thunder."

"It is okay." He back stepped and man-pulled Igala down from the ground rock and onto the first step into his arms with a wink and a smile. "I promise. This is going to be fun."

"No, I don't like fun. I like sun. I like dirt. I don't like rock."

He back stepped and man-pulled Igala from the first step down onto the second step. "I really don't wanna go backward down the staircase of rock. Can you walk down the rest of the way? I'll hold your arm."

"No."

"Yes."

"Naw."

"Yeah," he back stepped with a smile and man-pulled Igala down from the second step and onto the third step.

I stopped and stood in place, gathering up the skirt, turning with a gasp to see the pink tinted ceiling, the walls, and the floor. "This is a cave."

He moved ahead and spun around with a grin, standing beside Igala on top of the third step, slightly jerking her arm forward with movement, staring down into the cave floor with a smile. "Actually, this is a very large and deep underground cavern which is about three thousand feet down. So, we need to climb down the steps quickly before the sun sets at nighttime." He grabbed her arm and moved down to the next step a little faster. "A cavern is a hollow place in the ground which is large enough for a human to enter. Caves are made when rain water flood the dirt and erode the rock, creating a great big underground hole."

I moved with him down the stairs with a gasp. "This is a city."

"The dwellers of Society City Five are cavemen and cavewomen, sorta. They mine the rocks for food and supplies, since the outdoors or above ground surface is only hard rock. No type of farms for food, crops for harvest, beaches for swimming, trees for shade, plants for fruit, only the underground damp and dark caves."

I gasped at the beauty of the enclosed pink tinted walls of the cavern. "The cave people live down here all the time."

"Yes, the cavern is completely enclosed in pink tinted rock for safety with a row of artificial lights that hang down from the ceiling stone for seeing light. The staircase is very wide and jagged at the edges and then gradually tapers down to a set of narrow steps that leads into the main chamber of the cave."

"I see an array of individual cave openings, looking like a set of individual dark mouths."

"Yes, the forward and both sides of the cavern houses numerous same-sized dark holes that showed black tint which could are individual cave units."

"The caves are their homes."

He laughed. "The cavemen and cavewomen live inside caves."

I gasped. "I thought the beach was so pretty. The cavern is magnificent. And the walls twinkle at me."

He winked with a smile. "The pink walls are part of the cave. And I wink at you, too."

I stopped and stood in place, bending both kneecaps and touched the staircase step with a hand and a gasp. "The staircase walking step is solidly pink tinted. But there are very large dots or objects inside the smooth stepping stone." I stood upright and gathered my skirt into a hand, moving down to the next step, seeing the large dots, again."

"The cave people..."

"Do they label themselves as the cave people?"

"Yes, the cave people mine rocks. You are seeing the rock inside the stone. The rocks are different colors and shapes."

"Rocks are part of a cave, yes." I moved ahead over the smooth rock level steps. "Each step is getting narrower..."

".... leading down to the ground floor of the cave."

I stopped and stood in place on top of the next staircase walking step with a gasp and a worried heart. "Is this place safe? I mean we are going under the dirt and under the skyline. I mean, it is kinda scary and all."

He jerked her arm forward toward the next rock-covered staircase walking step with a smile. "Yes, it is very safe. The cave people have lived here for centuries. Look at the walls! The walls have been here for centuries."

The staircase meshed with the walls, enclosing a person within a narrow passageway. I stopped and stood in place on top of the next staircase walking step with a gasp, reaching out and touched the wall with a smile. "This rock feels smooth. It appears red in color. The next rock is green in color. The next rock is blue in color. The next rock is orange in color. Geez, the entire wall is made of different colored rocks that are partially embedded into the rock wall. This is beautiful and dangerous. The rocks are all jagged and pointy and protruded out from the wall. Someone could get harmed."

He jerked her arm in a forward movement again moving down the staircase rock-covered steps with a laugh and a smile. "Yeah, a stranger could get harmed, if the person didn't understand the staircase and the rocks."

"Like me..."

He stared ahead with a smile. "Naw, you are with me. I will not let anyone harm you, gorgeous."

I looked up with a smile to see the walls and the ceiling. "Now, I can only see the thick and tall walls that smash into the ceiling."

He held her arm for safety and stared ahead with a smile. "Look ahead of us!"

I looked down with a gasp and a grin to see the level floor of the single large cavern. "We have an official greeting committee. The cave people have formed two long lines of crowds. How many cavers live here?"

"About a few thousand or so, that is about five hundred people on each side to greet us."

I stomped down onto the ground floor. The flat floor of the cavern was smooth and level, displaying numerous sets of embedded colored rocks over the smooth surface. I stood in place with a gasp and a smile.

Ucal leaned over with a grin and a whisper into her eardrum. "Yeah, it is shocking. Over the centuries, the outer skin tone of each cave person has become slightly redden from the dust of the pink tinted rocks. Each one has a head of red hair and a pair of blue eyeballs."

I felt underdressed for the visitation within Society City Five, not possessing the elbow-length gloves or the re-designer purse or even one piece of jewelry, saying with a fake smile and a puff of shock. "I am shocked at their individual attire."

He smiled. "Yeah, the rocks are made into gem stones."

"The cave people wear an assortment of sparkling jewelry..."

"...all over their body parts, including the tongue. So, don't let a male kiss your face. I will get mad and have to remove his tongue piercing with my fists," he laughed.

I giggled. "Each cave person looks so elegant and beautiful like their home cave. They wear a set of evening gowns and furs and gloves and jewelry."

"Yeah, the inner guts of the cavern are cooler when it compared to the warm sunshine. They have formed a line for us. So, we slowly move down the line and then nod your head with a smile. This will be an attentive audience for an explanation of Zulu Time." Ucal jerked her hand forward toward the two lines of cave people.

I moved forward with a smile and a nod in silence.

Inside the row of cave people on my side of the line, the first little girl stepped forward and stopped, curtsying down to Igala with a smile, wearing an ankle-length dress of bright orange colored with the shape of tall yellow colored giraffe on the side. She wore a white animal fur colored jacket over the collar bone and the shoulder blades. Her hair was long and red down the back spine. Her skin was slightly pink tinted. Her skull was decorated in a tiny rounded tiara made of yellow stones. Both her naked wrists possessed an assortment of bracelets of orange colored stones. Her teeth were perfectly straight and white colored. Her eyeballs were light blue with golden specs. Her earlobes were pierced and held a set of yellow stones. Her shoes were flat ballerina-style with tiny orange colored stones. Both ankles wore a set of ankle bracelets of yellow stones. She extended both arms to Igala with a giggle as the single bracelet sounded with a set of tiny tings, presenting a bracelet of emeralds inside both open palms.

I stopped with a gasp and stood in place with a giggle, bending down on the kneecaps with a smile, extending a naked arm toward the little girl. The little girl reached out and decorated the arm of Igala with the emerald green bracelet. I smiled. "Thank you..."

The little girl smiled and back pedaled into the line with a giggle, standing between her parents. The mom of the little girl wore a red colored ankle-length gown with an outline of a bright pink ostrich in glowing stones on the side of the dress, a set of pink colored bracelets on each arm and a set of rings on each finger. She wore a larger tiara of red rubies on top of a skull of long red hair. Her earrings were long red colored dangling rubies. Her teeth were straight and white. She wore a shoulder wrap of pink fur around the collar bone. Her skin tone was red colored with a pair of light blue eyeballs. She wore an assortment of short to long throat necklaces around the neck. Her shoes were spiked heels with tiny pink stones on top of the stripes.

The father of the little girl wore a dark purple jacket with a matching pair of trousers. The long jacket possessed an upright weasel of green sparkling stones on the side. The jacket showed off a naked chest without a shirt. His shoes were decorated with a patch of green colored stones. All the fingers of both hands were covered in individual rings of different colored gem stones. His teeth were white and straight. His skin was red colored with a pair of dark blue eyeballs. His red hair was shoulder length over the earlobes. Each earlobe was pierced with a single earring of purple tinted stone. He didn't wear a fur coat. His throat and chest were covered in an assortment of short and long throat necklaces of green stones. And his forehead displayed a band of green colored stones like a crown of royalty.

I turned with a smile to see the nose profile of Ucal.

Ucal had knelt down onto one kneecap and extended an arm, receiving a bracelet of emeralds over the arm also. He nodded with a smile to the little boy.

The little boy moved back inside the row, wearing a tiny dark blue jacket with a matching pair of walking shorts. The jacket held an outline of yellow colored squared made of yellow stones. He wore a pair of flat shoes that were scattered with a set of tiny yellow color stones. Both the earlobes were pierced with a tiny yellow color stone. His smile was filled with nice straight and white teeth. His skin was baby tinted in pink hues. His jacket revealed a pink tinted chest without a shirt and a set of yellow colored necklaces. He did not wear a ring on a finger. His forehead was decorated with a band of yellow colored stones like a tiny prince among the cave people.

His mother was dressed in an ankle-length dress of light blue with a set of hearts on the side of the skirt in red rubies.

She reached out and grabbed her son, pulling him back into the dress, nodding with a smile in silence to Ucal.

His father wore a dark green colored long jacket with a matching pair of trousers. The long jacket possessed a column of silver diamond of squares on the side. The jacket showed off a naked chest without a shirt. The top of his shoes were decorated with a patch of silver diamond colored stones. All the fingers of both hands were covered in individual rings of different colored gem stones. His teeth were white and straight. His skin was red colored with a pair of blue eyeballs.

His throat and chest were covered in an assortment of short and long throat necklaces of silver diamond stones. And his forehead displayed a band of silver diamond stones like a crown of royalty. He reached over and wrapped an arm around his wife with a smile and a nod to Ucal in silence.

Ucal pivoted to the side and leaned over, assisting Igala to stand with him, cuddling her at the waist with a smile of the royal treatment from the cave people.

I stood upright with a smile and moved forward down the line with Ucal.

A second little girl stepped forward and curtsied to Igala with a smile, wearing an ankle-length dress of peach colored with a maroon flower in the shape of buttercup on the side and a maroon colored jacket over the collar bone and the shoulder blades. Her hair was long and red down the back spine. Her skin was slightly pink tinted. Her skull was decorated in a tiny rounded tiara made of maroon stones.

She extended both arms to Igala with a giggle as her bracelets sounded with tiny tings. She presented a single finger ring of emeralds inside both open palms.

I stopped with a giggle and stood in place, bending down on both kneecaps with a smile, extending the hand. The little girl reached out and decorated the hand of Igala with the finger ring. I reached out and wiggled the finger ring closer into the hand with a smile. "Thank you so much..."

The little girl smiled and moved back in the line with a giggle, standing between her parents.

The mother of the little girl wore an ankle-length dress of dark pink with an outline of a green stemmed long rose flower in the colors of golden stones with a shoulder wrap of golden fur. She wore a set of golden colored bracelets on each arm and a set of different colored gem stone rings on each finger. She wore a larger tiara of golden stones on top of a skull of long red hair.

She reached out and grabbed her daughter, pulling the child into the dress with a nod and a smile to Igala.

He leaned over and hugged his wife, nodding with a smile in silence to Igala.

I turned with a smile to see the nose profile of Ucal.

The little boy had presented a finger ring of emerald stones to Ucal.

Ucal accepted the ring and placed it on the finger with a smile and a nod in silence.

The little boy stepped backward into the long dress of the mom with a grin and a giggle, wearing a tiny aqua colored jacket of with a matching pair of walking shorts. The jacket held a climbing column of stars which was made of black tinted stones. He wore a pair of aqua colored flat shoes that were scattered on top with a set of tiny black color stones. Both the earlobes were pierced with a tiny aqua color stone. His smile was filled with a set of nice straight and white teeth. His skin was baby tinted in pink hues. His jacket revealed a pink tinted chest without a shirt and one single black colored necklace. He did not wear a ring on a finger. His forehead was decorated with a band of black colored stones like a tiny prince among the cave people.

His mother was dressed in an ankle-length dress of light green with a set of tiny outlines of the sun with extending rays of light on the side in blue colored stones.

He reached over and wrapped an arm around his wife with a smile and a nod to Ucal in silence.

Ucal pivoted to the side and leaned over, assisting Igala to stand with him, cuddling her at the waist with a smile of the royal treatment from the cave people.

I stood upright with a smile and moved forward down a narrow aisle of two rows of cave people with Ucal.

A third little girl stepped forward and curtsied to Igala with a smile, wearing an ankle-length dress of lavender colored with a climbing column of apple outlines on the side of the dress that were made of dark green stones. Her fur jacket was the same color as the apples. Her tiara and her arm and ankle jewelry glittered in dark green stones, too. She extended both arms and presented to Igala a single long golden necklace of emerald green stones within both palms with a giggle.

I stopped with a gasp and stood in place, looking up and ahead to see each cave person.

Each female wore an ankle-length gown of color with a different colored fur jacket, a set of neck, arms, fingers, and ankle jewelry of matching gem stones with the fur wrap. Each female wore a tiara of the matching fur color, also. Each gown contained some type of shape, such like, a geometric symbol, an animal, an earth element, a piece of fruit, and others.

Each male wore a long jacket with a matching pair of trousers of color and a set of rings on both hands and an assortment of necklaces on each neck with a pair of matching gem stone earrings on each earlobe. Each jacket contained some type of design on the side that complimented his wife and his child. Each male wore a forehead band of matching gem stones, too.

I exhaled with a puff of royalty and bent down on both kneecaps with a smile, extending the hand. The little girl reached out and decorated the hand of Igala with the necklace. I lifted up and dropped the necklace around my neck with a smile to the little girl, "Thank you so much..."

The little girl smiled and moved back in the line with a giggle, standing between her parents of smiles and glittering gem stones.

Ucal received a necklace of emerald green stones and placed around a neck with a chuckle.

The little boy moved back into the line with his parents.

Ucal turned and assisted Igala to stand next to him, slowly moving to the next little boy and little girl to receive the next gift from the cave people.

After thirty minutes of bending and standing, Ucal and I slowly traveled down the reception line and collected a jewelry item from each little girl and little boy.

I was covered in gem stones from head to toes. Literally, I wore a toe ring on the second toe bone of each foot in the different gem stone colors of pink and orange. Both ankles wore a three different type of gem stone bracelets of dark green, red, and purple. All my fingers contained a set of finger rings in the colors of pink, purple, yellow, red, green, blue, orange, and gold. Both wrists contained four bracelets in the colors of dark green, brown, black, blue, and mauve gem stone colors. My neck contains an assortment of short and long chains of different gem stone colors of dark gray, silver diamonds, dark blue, light green, peach, coral, pink, blue, and red. My earlobes contained a pair of dangling emerald stones. My forehead was decorated with a band of sapphires. My hair strands contained a single flat headband of red ruby stone.

The tall female with a head of red long hair and a pair of blue eyeballs stood upright at the end of the line with a smile and a nod to Ucal and Igala, wearing an electric blue gown with a matching tiara of blue stones with an assortment of mixed gem stone over both hands, her neck, her arms. She extended both arms in friendship with a nod and a smile. "Welcome to Society City Five! We are thrilled to have a set of nice visitors. And we enjoy crowning our new friends like a cave man and a cave woman. Please kneel! I will present the final piece of gem for our new friends."

I gathered up the skirt into a ball and knelt down with a giggle, landing onto the smooth but hard floor surface in silence. The crinolines of the dress protected my kneecaps from harm and bruises.

The tall female did not provide a name but reached over and grabbed a large crown of sparking emerald stones from the little girl on top of the satin covered pillow of orange, slowly lowering and placed the crown onto the black colored hair roots of Igala.

I giggled with the nice gift of real gem stones.

Then, the tall female removed both hands and turned to the little boy with a satin covered pillow of blue, grabbing a large crown of emerald green stones, turning and placed the crown over the shoulder length strawberry blonde colored hair roots of Ucal. She tossed both arms into the air with a smile. "There, you are a set of permanent residents of the cave people. But before we start the show, there is one more presentation." She leaned back without turning and grabbed the object from the rear table, tossing both hands into the air with a smile and a nod. "You must wear a set of eyeglasses. The eyeglasses allow you to see the entertainment in three dimensional for fun." She lowered a pair of eyeglasses to Igala and Ucal.

I reached out and grabbed the eyeglasses, pulling them into a smile. The eyeglasses were shaded like a pair of sunglasses, except the outer frame was decorated in a set of different colored gem stones. The inner lenses were colored in green tint. I turned with a smile to see Ucal. His pair of lenses was colored in blue tint. I turned back with a smile to the tall female cave woman.

She lifted and placed a pair of eyeglasses with a set of red tinted lenses.

I lifted the eyeglasses with a giggle and place them over my eye sockets. The pink stone walls of the cave winkled in an array of bright colors, where each rock hid and glittered in place. The lights were slightly tinted in green mist, but I could clearly see the faces of people and the food tables.

The female cave woman tossed both hands into the air with a smile and a nod. "Please, stand and start the show. Who wants to start the program first?"

Ucal stood upright with the silly eyeglasses and leaned over, helping Igala to stand with him, smiling at the cave woman female without a name and with a nod. He released Igala and slapped a chest as the throat necklaces wiggled and rattled in a set of tiny pings. "I will. I am Ucal. This is Igala. I will start my presentation."

She nodded with a smile to Ucal and thumbed over a collar bone to the wall behind a back spine. "Very well, you have the podium for the day." She stepped backwards and then side stepped from Ucal and Igala, moving ahead to the other side of the cave room for socializing with her new cave mates.

I stood upright in front of the podium and wore the funny looking green tinted eyeglasses, reaching down and touched each gem stone with a smile, enjoying the smoothness and the beauty.

The podium was made of pink tinted stone and rose up three tiers with a thick square shaped stand that held a wide tray.

Ucal dashed ahead and turned to the side, climbing up the three tiers of steps and turned again, moving ahead and stood in front of the podium and stopped, touching the smooth stone with both ringed hands and a smile. "Thank you! I am so pleased to be here at Society City Five. I am so pride of my new gifts from the cave people..."

I back stepped from the high podium and turned sideways, standing against the pink tinted wall like a wallflower, feeling some of the jagged and protruded gem rocks on my bare back spine with a fake smile. I continued to rub each gem stone with nervousness, since each cave man and cave woman turned and moved side to side, attacking the opposite wall with a set of short and numerous food tables.

Ucal stared out and over the numerous glittering crowns of tiara and naked hair roots of males with a smile and a nod, speaking into the hidden microphone as his voice echoed within the enclosed cavern. "The first tour of Zulu Time started with the eastern side of Society City Four..."

He shuffled through the crowd of pink tinted cave people and stopped, standing at her nose profile with a grin and a grunt. Igala continued to stroke the smooth gems tones. He smiled. "You are so beautiful, beauty."

I turned with a giggle to see a pair of funny eyeglasses of Dfee. He was slightly made of green tinted skin. "That's a double positive."

Ucal stared out and over the cave people with a smile and a nod into the microphone as his voice echoed throughout the cave. "I would like to say that we are the youngest duo survivors of Zulu Time..."

Dfee leaned over with a smile and a chuckle into her eardrum, blocking out the voice of Ucal. "Hmm, a double pretty is better than a double negative, like you ain't not gotta go to Zulu Time. Serpents..."

"Do not wand on curse on us, Dfee."

He frowned. "I am so sorry. I'm just very excited to see you, today, not in broad daylight."

Ucal smiled at the cave people and shouted into the microphone at the podium. "Your city is beautiful, here. We come from a beautiful city, too. We want to share personal experience with Zulu Time..."

I smiled. "A cave is a hollow place for people."

He smiled. "A cave is a holy place for people."

On the other side of the room, a set of musicians stood on top of another natural made rock shaped platform, lifting and blowing air through a set of musical instruments, performing a musical dance song. The rock and roll music echoed throughout the cave.

Ucal continued to shout through the music with the microphone inside the cave. The cave people spun around and invaded the empty floor, stopping and stood in place, twisting the hips and dancing with couples or alone to the fast paced musical song. Ucal smiled into the microphone. "Igala only want into Zulu Time, because she was in a car..."

Dfee leaned closer into her eardrum with a grin. "Well, we should imitate the cave people and dance within the crowd, too."

"I don't know. Ucal knows the color of my dress."

He smiled. "I like the color of your dress, too."

Ucal smiled and shouted through the microphone, "Me and Igala went into Zulu Time as a Tag Team, because we were..."

"Ucal can't see you over the height of tallest dang podium in the world. We are standing directly underneath the thing."

"I guess..."

"I guess so." He reached out with a grin and grabbed her hand, turning and dragged Igala into the dance floor. He stopped and stood underneath the podium overhang, pulling her closer into a chest, slowly dancing side to side within the fast paced song. No cave person seemed to notice the young couple, who wore a pair of funny eyeglasses and body jewelry like the others.

Ucal smiled over the dancing people and shouted over the loud music. "I have been to the beautiful beaches within Society City Two. But this cavern is..."

Dfee smiled. "He has a great set of lungs."

I frowned. "I guess."

He smiled into her eardrum. "Okay, we need to leave from here."

I didn't pull back with a puzzled brow and shouted into his face. "Leave? I can't leave from here."

He leaned into her face with a smile. "Of course, you can. There are numerous individual caves to explore for fun."

I looked back over a collar bone with a puzzled brow. "I see all the individual cases that are built all over the wall which are tinted in darkness. Those are the home caves of the cave people."

"Yes, they are. But on the bottom level here, there are a series of tall entrance holes of darkness that led into a set of exploring caves. The caves are too cold, too damp, too dark, and too wet for a living person. So, it is the nightly entertainment show for the cave people."

I turned with a gasp to examine the people and the walls within the cave. "Why are there no com-ds on the cave people? Why are there no glass windows for to broadcast the Zulu Time program in here?"

He smiled. "You must ask Ucal those questions. He is the expert on Zulu Time, not I."

I growled. "I will."

Dfee shoved her backward and moved away from the dance floor. "Look, we will slowly dance away from the podium and out of his eyesight. Then we dash into the opening of the new cave. I got a surprise for you, beauty."

I smiled. "You do?"

He grabbed her wrist and swayed side to side, moving ahead from the rock podium and toward the wall of cave houses, dancing with the music.

I swayed side to side, moving backward with a stern face, watching Ucal on top of the podium.

Ucal continued to smile over the hair roots of the dancing people and shouted over the music. "Zulu Time starts at five in the afternoon...."

Dfee side stepped and moved ahead, dragging Igala by the hand, disappearing into the dark mouth of the cave with cold temperatures of dampness and darkness.

I swung around and entered the mouth of the cave with a gasp and a smile. "Now, I understand the eyeglasses. It is a form of light inside the dark cave. I can see everything brilliantly and vividly."

"Yeah, the cave people have adapted well down here." He led down a wide flat passageway of pink tinted rocks that housed numerous stone sized structures. "A cave is formed from varied geologic processes and chemical processes, such as, erosion from water, tectonic forces, microorganisms, pressure, and atmospheric influences. Once formed, a cave is adorned with stalactites, stalagmites, and columns of stone."

I reached out and touched each column of stone with a smile. "Where are we going?"

"To our private underground cave, I had reserved one for our fun, today."

I gasped. "How did you do that? Wait, how did you get here from the beaches of Society City Two?"

He chuckled. "I have my methods."

"Show me your methods."

"I plan to show you all my methods." He turned with a chuckle and led down over a new wider passageway, dragging the hand of Igala with a smile.

I slowly trailed behind his back spine and reached out, touching each smooth stalagmite inside the new underground cave with a smile, seeing the twinkles through the funny sunglasses. "This is the most beautiful formation on the planet. I can see why the cave people like to live here."

He turned the stone corner and stopped, standing inside a short archway that touched his hair roots with a smile, seeing the twinkle in her face, "Our cave, beauty."

I turned the corner and stopped, ripping off the sunglasses and stood beside Dfee with a smile and a gasp. "The tiny cave is completely enclosed on three sides. There's a small pond..."

He entered the cave floor and moved ahead to the columns of stones, ripping off the sunglasses too. "It is an underground fresh water stream that flows throughout the caverns." He stopped and stood in place with a smile.

I stopped and stood beside Dfee, holding his hand, staring down at the object. "Nice! You set us up a private picnic area with a blanket and a basket of food, so sweet. Thank you, Dfee."

"Yeah," he reached out and touched wrapped an arm around her waist with a smile.

"So, cool." I reached out with a smile and touched the flying droplets, coming from the waterfall. "And we have a baby waterfall that glitters indifferent colors of red, blue, green, yellow, and orange."

"So, hot," He reached out and touched her naked back spine that was displayed from the rear of the dull pink gown with a smile. "I like this gown best. Can you keep it?"

"I guess." I turn and scan the new the cave, moving toward the picnic arena, "So, cold."

He reached over and touched her arm with a smile, "So, heated."

I turned and frowned at the walls of the cave. "The cave is cold in temperature to me." He released her body and removed the jacket, placing it around her shoulders with a smile. I smiled. "I didn't realize a cave was so dark. Where are we located?"

He chuckled, "The belly of the beast."

I giggled. "And what's inside the belly of beast?"

"Me and you, beauty," He wrapped both arms around her waist and lifted Igala from the floor, over the ankle-length wall, landing her shoes inside the picnic space.

I laughed. "The belly of the beast has light illumination. Is there glowing algae or another glowing critter, here?"

He stepped over the ankle-length wall with a smile, "Just, a beauty and a beast."

I stood and stared at the object with a smile. "Awe, you have placed a set of candles inside a square and around our spot with the picnic basket of food."

"Thanks, kindly." He lifted her over the candles and landed her on top of the blanket near the food basket. "You haven't eaten, right?" He assisted her to sit around the basket and away from the candle fire.

I sat down with a sour frown and placed the funny eyeglasses near the basket. "No, Ucal is always so happy to talk about Zulu Time first. I just stand around or sit around until he finally gets frustrated like the two previous events. He looked a little worried."

He sat beside her and placed the funny eyeglasses near the basket. He leaned over, opening the lid and lifted each item from the guts of basket into the air and landed each food item over the blanket. "I should be a little worried."

I reached down and lifted the food item near a frown. "Why would you worry, Dfee?"

He turned and winked at her, holding the food item near a mouth. "I just don't want to get caught with you here." Dfee ate and chewed the food.

I shook my curls and my tiara with a smile. "I wouldn't be too concerned. The Regulators didn't seem to notice that I'm absent during the daytime or nighttime hours, especially when you find and use a secret passage way. I didn't realize there were some many old buildings left within the Society Cities."

He chewed and swallowed the food item with a smile. "That is part of re-designing a building. The new buildings in the early part of this century were really cheap material crumbling and tumbling down onto the street. A re-designer only re-located the structure that had lived through hurricanes, floods, and blizzards. Then, those old buildings were gutted and re-generated for a new business or a family unit. My home is like that. You home is like that, too." He ate and chewed the food item.

I chewed and swallowed the food with a grin. "Wow. I'm impressed, Dfee."

He chewed and swallowed the food with a grin. "I have something to impress you with more, beauty. I graduated, today."

I leaned over and kissed his food stained lips, pulling back with a smile, wiping off my hands and my lips on the re-designer evening dress. "Wow, today, congratulations, Dfee! I was wondering how you were attending Hall while sneaking around entertaining me during the stupid Tour of Zulu Time. I don't understand why we are touring within each Society City. And I really appreciate you sneaking around and entertaining me, too, beast."

He chewed and swallowed the food item with a smile. "I enjoyed sneaking around, spying on you, and running from the Regulators."

I frowned. "How are you able to sneak around and come into each Society City? I thought it was illegal or something. Ucal said that it was illegal to come into a Society City."

He wiggled both eyebrows at her with a smile. "It is, but I have my ways."

"What ways?"

He leaned over and kissed her lips, pulling back with a smile and a wink. "Me and Ucal, we get our last series of electronic classes through our com-d. Me and Ucal, we are neighbors, first and friends, second. Me and Ucal, we have been doing stuff together, since our birth. And I don't understand stupid, either. But, I really understand you, beauty." He ate and chewed the food item.

"His mom is a Regulator." I ate and chewed the food item.

He chewed and swallowed the food item with a grin. "His dad is a Regulator, too. That was one reason we kinda grow up like brothers. He would come over to my house learning with teacher-robot along with me." He ate and chewed the next food item.

"Is that why you didn't wanna be a Regulator?" I ate and chewed the next food item.

He chewed and swallowed the food with a smile. "I think the Regulators are important components within our Society. They keep peace and order. But, I don't wanna be one, even thou I turned eighteen, today."

I chewed and swallowed the food with a stern face. "When did you do that, Dfee?"

He chewed and swallowed the food with a smile, "Today."

I dropped the food and leaned over, kissing his food stained lips with mine, pulling back with a smile, "Happy birthday, Dfee! I'm so silly. The only way to graduation is to be eighteen years old. What are your plans, now, next?"

He smiled. "I have been offered a re-generation job in food production." He ate and chewed the new food item.

"Is that what you want to do for the rest of your life?" I ate and chewed the new food item.

He chewed and swallowed the food item with a chuckle, "A food job, where I can re-design food." He reached down and patted the belly with a smile. "I like to eat. Now, I can re-design it, clone it, and eat it all at the same time as the test re-designer. The re-generation company is located on the outskirts of Society City Four which is more inside the beautiful wild and free countryside. I get a house, a plot of land, a car, and paid very well. I can even get a horse or two." He ate and chewed the new food item.

I chewed and swallowed the food with a smile. "Congratulations, Dfee! That is your life's dream. When do you start working your new re-designer food job?" I ate and chewed the new food item.

He chewed and swallowed the food with a smile. "Well, I can start tomorrow, but I was thinking of putting it off for another day or two. You and Ucal are returning back to Society City Four, tomorrow." He ate and chewed the food item.

I chewed and swallowed the food with a frown. "I'll see before you depart for the peaceful countryside."

He chewed and swallowed the food with a frown. "No." He wiped both hands and a mouth on the new re-designer napkin.

I coughed and chewed, swallowing the food with a sad frown. "No. You're going to leave before I say good-bye." I dropped the food item over the blanket and wiped off both hands and a mouth my dress for my fun and annoyance to my mom.

He smiled. "I don't want to say goodbye to you, Igala. I want you to come with me."

I shook my curls and my emerald sparkling tiara with a sad face. "I am leaving for another Society City, tomorrow. I can't be absent from the Tour of Zulu Time. Then, the Regulators will suspect something was wrong. And then, I'll be tossed back into Zulu Time for something wrong. Honestly, I can't take around round of Zulu Time. I have experienced and survived too many rounds of Zulu Time already."

He stood upright one on knee and presented the object to Igala. "I wanna marry you, beauty."

I parted my lips with a smile at the object, "Awe, a white cupcake with a set of pink hearts."

He frowned. "I don't have a ring for you..."

I lifted up and wiggled a handful of rings with a smile and a nod. "You can borrow one of mine?"

He laughed. "Naw, I want to pick out the ring for you, beauty. I love you, Igala. Please marry me, beauty?"

I smiled with a nod. "I wanna marry you, beast. But, I'm not eighteen yet. I have another two months."

He grinned. "We tell your parents and then get married. There is a Hall near the re-generation food company. You can attend classes and then graduation in the next two months. Then, you can get a re-gen job at the food company with me. And then, we live happily ever after with two horses, three dogs, and one child, all in that order." He chuckled with a smile.

I stood upright and turned to face the wall, moving ahead and touched the cold stone with a worried brow and a worried heart. I had other interior worries besides breaking the heart of Ucal. Ucal was going to be a Regulator within the Society City Four. He had planned and prepared for that event all his life like his biological parents.

I really didn't want to be a Regulator like Ucal. And I didn't know what type of re-gen job that I would receive or become at the moment until I graduated from Hall.

However, the parents of Igala were hinting too much and too often that their eldest daughter should marry Ucal over Dfee. Even though, her parents didn't know how Igala felt about Dfee over Ucal.

I really loved Dfee and enjoyed his company and wanted to be his wife and the mother of his child. I exhaled with a puff of worry at the wall. "Dfee, have you been visiting the presentations, the dances, or the dinners too during the stupid Tour of Zulu Time?"

He lowered the cupcake back down to the blanket with a smile and stood upright, spinning around, moving forward and stopped, standing and wrapped both arms around her waist. "No, I can't stand seeing you dancing with Ucal. It makes me jealous." He snuggled a nose into her neck with a warm breath, "Grr!"

I exhaled. "I haven't danced with Ucal, only you. And none of the visitations have been like a party, only disappointment. But before the tour of Zulu Time, I heard some rather whispered nasty remarks."

He cuddled and kissed her neck, pulling back with a worried brow, "What whispered nasty remarks, beauty?"

I touched the wall with a worried brow and a worried heart. "I thought that I overhear some persons or some people say the word, criminal, after I have survived Zulu Time."

He chuckled. "Well, I would be the criminal and it would be a crime, not to marry you, beauty."

I swung around and slap his arm with an angry brow. "More than some people, groups of people..."

He frowned. "Is Ucal concerned or the Regulators?"

"No."

"Then, you don't need to worry about it, either. Some folks complain about everything, including the free wind, the free rain, the free sun, the free..."

I leaned over and kissed his lips, pulling back with a smile. "Free me!"

He smiled with a nod. "I would ignore it, so you should ignore it, too. Think about us, beauty. We are sneaking away from Ucal and leaving Society City Five tonight near midnight for our secret wedding. Is that an okay plan, beauty?"

I smiled. "I am okay with that new sneaky and snaky plan. But, Ucal will be..."

"So jealous, I wished that I could invite him to our wedding, but I would have to beat his butthole and then hog-tie him into the wall corner during the forever marriage ceremony."

I laughed. "You would do that for me."

He winked. "It's for me, beauty."

"I love you, beast." I leaned over and kissed him with true love and happiness.

He pulled back with a smile and released her, reaching up and unwrapped the emerald green jewelry band from his forehead with a wink and a smile. "I know. This is my forehead band that came from the cave people. It is not a real ring, but it will be a bond between us, until I get a real ring for you. So, I give this band of emerald gems to my beauty that I love with all my heart and my soul." He lifted up the band. She held up a waist bone. Dfee wrapped the band of emerald stones around her waist with a smile of love, leaning over and kissed her lips with happiness, too.

I shoved Dfee from my lips and my body with a sour frown and a matching tone. "Now, we are official engaged to marry for the rest of our lives. Tell me how you were able to get into all the different Society Cities without getting arrested or killed? I don't trust Ucal but I do believe him." Dfee laughed with a smile.

I frowned, "Dfee?"

He reached down and grabbed the object from the pocket of the blue jeans, lifting it up and near a smile.

I gasped. "That is a collector bar." I automatically reached down and tapped on the tiny pouch inside my dress with a worried brow. The collector bar was there inside the plastic pouch safe.

He smiled with a nod. "Right, beauty, I have coin. Coin gets you anywhere you want to go within any Society City."

I gasped. "You paid the Regulators that stand in front of each steel gate."

"I must pay each Regulator that stands in front of each steel gate to get in and to get out. Then, I must pay the host and hostess of each Society City to stay and to play with you, beauty."

I slapped his chest with a frown. "That is..."

"...exactly what Ucal has done, too?"

"What? Why?"

He grinned. "You should ask him that question."

"I don't wanna ask Ucal any questions. I don't trust Ucal, but I do believe him. Can we leave from here, tonight, Dfee?"

He rattled the collector bar with a wink and a smile. "I have enough coin for us to leave here and return back into Society City Four. Then, we can get married and live outside of the city and inside the countryside for the rest of our married days and nights as we work our one dimensional re-gen jobs. And I can't wait until the honeymoon."

I reached out and touched his dirty shirt with a smile. "Thank you. I like that plan, too."

He reached down and replaced the collector bar back into the pocket of the blue jeans with a smile. "Now, we should leave from our cave."

"Why?"

"It is close to one in the afternoon or so. Ucal will be looking for you and me."

"He suspects you..."

He grinned. "He suspects you and me."

"Yeah, I see."

"Yeah, I see, too. Are you finished eating?"

"Yeah, I have finished eating."

"Good, we need to find your individual suite." He back stepped and spun around, leaning down and grabbed both pairs of eyeglasses and stood upright, turning to face her with a smile. "You need your eyeglasses."

I reached out and grabbed the funny eyeglasses with a confused brow. "Why? I can see with my naked eyeballs."

"Not the metal door that holds your personalized name."

I gasped. "What?" He spun around and grabbed her hand, leading Igala around the blazing candles of white fire and toward the ankle-length wall. I turned and frowned down at the messy picnic spot. "What about the picnic basket and the used food and glowing candles?"

"I'll come right back here and clean up our spot. The cave people don't like litter bugs," he stopped at the ankle-length wall with a laugh and scooted around, lifting Igala into the air and over the tiny wall for her safety.

I landed on the other side with a giggle.

Dfee climbed over the ankle-length wall and grabbed her hand with a stern face, moving ahead through the archway. "Okay, we are silent and move swiftly until we find your suite. I don't want Ucal to realize that we were inside the cave. He might get mad and find me. Then, he will be paying to leave Society City Five alone on top of a medical cot with a broken nose and a broken arm," softly chuckling.

They swiftly moved through the passageway in silent and stood inside the cave, wearing the pair of funny eyeglasses and all the body jewelry, looking like a cave man and a cave woman.

Ucal continued to stand upright at the podium and shouted a voice over the loud music over the tiaras and naked hair roots of the dancing cave people. "The word Tag is a very important part of Zulu Time..."

Dfee laughed. "Geez, the boy could blow up a hover car and steer it to the end of the planet without fainting. No more lovey-dovey moves on me, beauty. We go this way." He released her and moved ahead, turning to the side to see a second staircase rock-covered walking set of steps on the far wall, strolling ahead without holding the hand of Igala. Since Ucal could clearly see the both of them from the podium. He stopped and climbed up the staircase turning to the side, moving down the fourth tier.

They passed beside an array of closed metal doors.

I turned with a puzzled brow and stared at the metal door, wearing the eyeglasses with a gasp. "I can see a name here on surface of the door. So, each cave is marked for each resident of the cave people."

He moved ahead and turned to see each door also. "Each door is metalized to accept your DNA sweat or touch. Then, your personal DNA marks the door for your person. No one can come in or go out without your touch, again. Thus, I am satisfied that Ucal can come into your room until I can come and get your first."

I stared with a confused brow at each marked metal door. "Why is that important, Dfee?"

"It just is." He stopped and turned with a smile to face the metal door. "This is one is empty. You can see through the eyeglasses that the door is empty of a name. Press an index finger and write out your name on the metal. That's how the name appears. Or else, I can't find you, again."

I lifted and held an index finger near the metal, feeling the heat. "Does it hurt?"

He laughed, "Naw."

I slammed the index finger pad into the metal with a hiss and sour frown. "Yeah, it does slightly sting. You're mean, Dfee." I printed each letter of my name onto the door and removed the hand with a frown. Like magic, my name in big letters of Igala appeared on the metal door in the color of bright pink. "Wow, this is so cool. How does it work?"

"It has something to do with the mineral of the stone here inside the cavern. All doors work like that, too. I can't lean over and kiss your face, but you are inside my heart and my pants," he chuckled.

I frowned, "Dfee?"

"Go inside and wait for me to return."

"I should wait for Ucal."

"He's too busy with the entertaining the cave people. And he never comes back to see you at the suite, anyways. Am I right?"

"Okay, you're right. How will I know that it is you outside my door?"

"The metal will flash on both sides of the door to alert you that someone is outside. Then, you press your hand or your nose to the metal. The door will automatically open to your touch."

"Cool! I got it. Which level will you be staying on?" I turned with a smile to see his face.

He looked down with a stern face to see the waist watch com-d and spun around, moving ahead without seeing Igala. "Close by! I gotta go. Go inside and wait for me. I will return, beauty."

I frowned at his back spine and turned to see the meal door with my name, reaching out and pressed the metal door with a heated sting, again.

The door opened.

At 01:01 pm on the early afternoon, I moved inside with a puzzled brow and removed the eyeglasses to see suite. The sleeping suite was a very tiny compared to the other two previous suites of the Tour of Zulu Time. The room was curved with set of enclosed pink tinted walls that matched the external cavern walls with a curved archway about two-thirds deep into the room that separated the sitting room from the bedroom space.

The ceiling held a set of dull illuminated artificial lights that didn't blind the eyeballs.

There was a small bed frame against the straight part of the far wall.

I strolled a few feet inside.

The door automatically closed behind a back spine, making Igala feel trapped like a pest.

Each side wall was made of the pink tinted stone and curved out for closet space of clothing or shelf space of objects, such like, a body of gem stones.

I couldn't hear the music or the voice of Ucal at the podium, coming from the external cavern, either, making the tiny room eerie to my senses. I moved through the archway and stopped, standing in place with a gasp. "I don't have any piece of my luggage, again. This is very bad habit." I tossed the pair of eyeglasses onto the bed covers, slamming both hands down to the dirty gown with a sour frown.

The bedroom nightstand was posed at the head of the bed frame which was made of solid green stones.

I moved ahead and stopped, standing beside and leaned down, reaching out to caress the night stand with a gasp and a smile, "The night stand is made one body square shaped emerald gem stone. This thing would be worth a fine set of coin inside Society City Four. Then, I would have to never work a re-gen job." I turned to the side wall to face a taller chest of drawers with a gasp and a smile. "The single piece chest of drawers was made from a solid rectangular shape of red ruby stones. Wow, this furniture is beautiful. Now, I see why the cave people dance all the time with happiness." I turned and lifted up the thick bedcovers of bed frame with a gasp and a smile. "The bed frame is made of solid sapphire stones." I yawned with an ugly mouth and dropped down the bedcovers. "I'm tired from the food and the dance and Dfee," giggling. "Well, midnight will come soonest for me and then a secret marriage of happiness. I am so excited about my marriage. My parents will be shocked." I leaned down and fell over the soft blanket with a smile and a whisper, resting on a back spine, wearing the jewelry of gem stones. I was too tired and full of Dfee to remove all the gems, whispering for my eardrums only. "I am getting married to Dfee. I am so happy."

I closed my eyelashes with a smile, dreaming of Dfee and my future happy life.

At 04:04 pm within the late afternoon, the metal door flashed in the color of hot pink off and on in silence.

I blinked my eyelashes open from a bright light of single sun ray and gasped, turning to see the flashing metal door with a whisper and a smile. "Dfee..."

I rolled off the bed mattress and tumbled forward, dragging the bed covers over the floor, feeling the jewelry and heard the rattle of the tings of metal. I dashed forward toward the door with a smile, slamming into the metal for fun with both hands, back stepping with a giggle.

The door slid open.

The back spine of Ucal faced Igala. "We need to leave from here, now."

I gasped at his back spine with a worried brow. "What? Why?"

He spun around with a smile and wore the funny blue tinted cave man eyeglasses. "I am done. I give my presentation..."

"But it is only..."

"Afternoon, we need to leave, right now."

I gasped, "My luggage?"

"Our luggage is still packed inside the car. And you look very nice in your gem stones." He reached up to touch her face and dropped down a hand, grabbing her wrist, spinning around and dragged her down the corridor. "We need to leave. The cave people like to give out invites. And then they like for the invites to leave as soon as possible."

I gathered the dirty skirt into a ball with one hand. Ucal tightly held the other hand. I frowned with worry about Dfee. "Can we stay a little longer?" I followed behind the back spine of Ucal with worry, turning and swiftly moving down the staircase and as, my eyeballs darted down to the dance floor. The music was not playing. There was not a musical band either. The floor was filled with huddles of cave people.

I didn't have the funny eyeglasses that enhanced the colors on the walls and the cave people. I searched each male looking for the blonde hair of Dfee. He was dressed in a silly jacket color of peach with a climbing purpled colored deer figure on the side. I wondered where he received or stolen the jacket. I couldn't miss his body frame, either.

"No, there is nothing for us to stay with." Ucal swiftly dashed down the rock-covered walking staircase that led up to the individual cave rooms or down to the dance floor. He was in a rush to leave the cavern and Dfee. He had seen his childhood pal on the dance floor, dancing with Igala.

Then, Dfee and Igala had disappeared from the dance floor.

Ucal didn't see what direction but didn't have to guess. There were numerous individual and smaller unexplored caves for fun and adventure. Dfee found one and took Igala there, this morning. Ucal rushed down the staircase and tightly held her hand with a growl. Igala was his girl. He had made it very clear to Dfee before the start of the Tour of Zulu Time.

However, Dfee had acquired coin, somehow. The coin was paid to a Regulator and then the steel gate was opened for the payer.

I could not find Dfee and felt worried and alarmed. Dfee didn't know that Ucal and I were leaving the cavern right now, going someplace else. I frowned. "Where are we going?" I found it easier to move down the staircase rather than climbing up the steps, holding the front hem of the skirt. The dress train elegantly flowed and spread behind my back spine. I thought that Ucal was moving at a very fast pace for some strange reason. I was a little concerned about falling down the steps but Ucal would break my fall, if that would happen.

He stomped down the last step on the stone covered staircase and dashed over the empty part of the dance floor, moving ahead toward the exit staircase that went up to the rock surface with a stern face. "We are leaving and heading to Society City One, the mountains. I need some fresh air out from the rock. I feel trapped and enclosed here. Do you feel trapped inside a cavern, too?"

"Yeah..." I turned with a worried brow and a worried heart, re-scanning the dance floor. Each male stood inside a huddle that wasn't Dfee.

Ucal stomped up the first step of the exit staircase, dashing up the steps toward the bright light of day. "We will leave here and arrive within the cool mountains. The lush green and brown mountains are very pretty this time of year. And at night, the moon is so close on the peak of the mountains that you could almost reach out and touch it with a finger. Does that sound nice, Igala?" The scene on the mountain peak will be nice with Igala inside his arms. Dfee will not be there, either. Ucal had been communicating with the Regulators. It took Ucal a few days to figure out how Dfee was getting around by coin.

However, Ucal had a row of Regulators that he trusted, because Ucal trusted his mom, too. The new row of Regulators would ensure that Dfee went back home to Society City Four without a physical violent, only the verbal threat of bodily harm.

"Yeah..." I climbed up the entrance staircase of walking steps behind the back spine of Ucal, feeling panic and worry, not seeing Dfee inside the cavern.

Dfee told Igala that he was sticking around and would be close. So, Dfee was outdoors, somewhere. Then, he would see Igala and Ucal as they approached the limousine. Thus, Dfee could follow the limousine like he had been doing since the first day of the Tour of Duty.

Ucal huffed and puffed with new jealousy, moving up the entrance staircase, hitting the dull sunlight and wiped the mist from a face.

I huffed and puffed in panic and exhaustion. It was great physical task moving down a set of staircases, over a dance floor, and up a second staircase in a pair of three-inched re-designer spiked heels and a three-foot dirty re-redesigned evening dress. I landed on the top step of the exit staircase and stopped, standing in place with a gasp and worried brow.

Ucal released her hand and wiped the mist from a face, moving ahead toward the open door of the limousine.

I slowly climbed up onto the solid rock soil of Society City Five and followed behind the back spine of Ucal with a gasp and a worried brow. "It is foggy here. The clouds have fall down from the sky and are floating over the flat pink tinted rock, making a white fog over everything. I don't understand. I can't see anything that is no more than three inches in front of my face. What is this? Is this a rain storm or something related to the weather?"

Ucal stopped and stood in place in front of the open door of the limousine, nodding with a smirk to the driver. The driver nodded back in silence. Ucal exhaled with a smirk. "It is the heated late afternoon. The low hanging clouds drop down from the skyline by wind storms, rolling over the flat rock and then the heated rock enter the clouds. Then, the clouds hang around for a few hours over the rock and then heat rises. Each cloud rises and drifts back up into the skyline until evening comes."

I dashed across the flat rock ground and wiped the mist from a face with a cough, stopping and stood behind Ucal with a worried brow and a worried heart. Dfee will not see Igala and Ucal leave the rock surface.

Ucal slumped down and entered the rear bench with a chuckle, sliding over to the opposite window. Dfee will not see Ucal and Igala leave within the thick fog of the late afternoon. The limousine used a set of internal instruments to guide the vehicle over the rock surface and through the thick fog without crashing, flying back toward the set of two steel gates.

I folded at my waist and dropped a skull down toward the rock surface, wearing the silly tiara. Ucal had removed all the body gifts of jewelry, after the warm greeting of the Zulu Time team this morning.

I had been entertained by Dfee during the morning and the early afternoon and then I had found a cave room and felt into a light catnap of slumber. I scooted across the bench seating and stopped, sitting near the open door.

The door closed. The driver turned and entered the limousine, preparing for departure, pressing the control levers. The vehicle slowly lifted up from the rock surface and hovered inside a thick patch of white clouds.

I turned and pressed both hands and a nose profile into my glass window, feeling the warm temperatures of the raising heat from the rock surface, scanning through the fog. I could not see beyond the edge of the cloud cover.

The limousine lifted higher into the air and as, the thick clouds encompassed the vehicle. Then the vehicle flew with great speed in the proper direction of west toward the set of steel gates that entered into Society City Four, leaving Society City Five.

Ucal sat back with a smirk and a chuckle. "Ah, I love foggy conditions. It hides and heals all matters."

My eyelashes darted side to side at the foggy conditions over the landscape and as, I felt the smooth waves of the air currents underneath the long bench seat. I could not see any speckle of pink tinted solid rock surface. I worried that Dfee would return and find my room empty. Wait! Dfee could not enter the room without my touch. Wait! My DNA would be probably wiped away, since I had left the cave people.

Good. He would come and check on Igala and find her gone from the private room and within Society City Fire. Dfee would know of the next Society City tour, since Ucal had known also.

I continued to lean against the cool window with worry and hunted for a sigh of Dfee.

Then, the foggy clouds lifted from the rock surface and showed off the deep canyon. The canyon displayed an array of bright and vivid colors of greens, browns, tans, reds, oranges, pinks, and other colors.

I stared down with a gasp at the landscape. "We're crossing over Dead Man's Land. I can see sets of moving vehicles over the ground. And I think that some of them are a set of airships. I thought you said that the natives were primitive."

Ucal stared ahead with a smile to see the foggy white of the clouds that blinded the front wind shield. "They are farmers. It is some of their farm equipment that shifts and moves over the land and the air."

I leaned into the window and smelled my sour breath. "I see an airship that is moving through the air which is half-way between the land and the cliff of the canyon. I thought you said that they were uneducated."

"They are farmers. They have to eat food and to make clothing to survive the wilds of Dead Man's Land. So, they have a few air ships. No matter! They don't harm anyone. Let them be, Igala. We will arrive in the afternoon within Society City One. We will have dinner and then we can take a hike up the mountain side. There is a walking path that shows off all the pretty flowers and plants. Do you like roses?"

"Yeah..." I continued to stare down in the valley of Dead Man's Land, seeing the rows of colored crops and scattered square shaped houses with patches of lush forestland with curiosity.

The limousine slowed the pace and halted above the landscape of Dead Man's Land and within the air waves.

I turned and smashed a nose bridge into the widow, seeing one side of the long steel gate.

The driver dropped the window, listening to the Regulator. The Regulator nodded and back stepped from the limousine. The steel gate shifted and parted with an open space, squealing from the rust. Then, the limousine flew forward through, gathering speed and reached one hundred miles per hour, steering between the land and the white clouds.

"Ugh!" I continued to lean against the window to see new landscape. "The landscape is constant blurry blend of colors. It makes me nausea." I turned and faced the rear window for the first time. The steel gate slowly closed up and locked in place, forming a giant looking spider web of shiny silver tinted steel. I exhaled with a puff of worry, not seeing a second airship behind the limousine. I thought Dfee would be tailing behind the limousine, now. I flipped around and stared ahead through the windshield at the white clouds, the dull sunshine, and the absent landscape.

The limousine airship was too high into the skyline for a ground view.
286th day of the year

Society City Four

04:04 pm (early afternoon)

Zulu Time Building

Warm temperatures and gray skies

City street setting

The limousine reduced speed and halted in the air, slowly dropping down over the rough pavement, landing with a soft thud.

I continued to twist each ring finger with worry and nervousness with hope. Dfee had seen the limousine leave Society City Five and then he would be traveling through the steel gate and into Society City Four right now. I didn't trust Ucal, since he was jealous of his best pal Dfee.

I sat beside Ucal on top of the rear bench seat and reached up, touching the smooth gems on the pointy tiara, both pair of earrings, rows of necklaces, rows of bracelets, rows of finger rings, making my finger pads feel silky with a gasp and a scream, staring out into the side window of the limousine. I faced the Cee Building on the campus of Zulu Time. "Why are we here at the Zulu Time Building, Ucal?"

He was a tall teen male with a head of shoulder length strawberry blonde colored hair, a face of red dusted whiskers, a pair of blue eyeballs, and a tone of pale tinted skin, without any type of makeup facial decoration, and a pair of rippled muscles underneath a peach colored satin sports jacket, wearing a re-designer white T-shirt with a pair of ripped and faded re-designer blue jeans. And his favorite pair of cowboy boots of aquamarine and black polished colors. Ucal turned and gasped with a frown through the window at the building and the location, reaching for the door handle. "What the fudge is this?"

The door opened on his side of the limousine.

"Ucal?" I slid over the bench seat with a scream of worry and stood upright in front of the open doorway of the limousine with a worried heart. I had been driven back to Society City Four and at the Zulu Time Building for some weird reason.

Ucal tumbled forward from the open door and stood upright with a sneer, standing over the hair roots of the shorter golden tinted Regulator. "What the fudge is this?"

"Zulu Time..." The Regulator stood even with the chest of Ucal and droned in an alto timber without a smile or an emotion. "It is Zulu Time."

Ucal gasped. "Are we guests at the Zulu Time Ball? The time is close for the start of the ball at five in the afternoon."

"Zulu Time begins on time each evening."

Ucal sneered. "What has happened? What is happening? What's going on here, Regulator?"

The two Regulators scooted around Ucal and stood beside Igala. One droned in alto timber without emotion into the nose profile of Igala without a smile. "Criminal Igala Smith is invited to Zulu Time. I am escorting you into the Cee Building with the other members of the Smith family to appear inside Zulu Time." The Regulator reached out and grabbed the arm of Igala.

I felt the smooth golden tinted hand on my arm with a gasp of worry. "No, wait! Why? What for? I did nothing, this time, today. I'm not guilty here. I did my time in Zulu Time."

"You are the criminal, who will be escorted into the Cee Building," The golden colored skin and hair of the Regulator twinkled underneath the bright sunlight of the afternoon.

I turned with a worried brow and a worried heart of pain to see the nose profile of Ucal, "Ucal?"

"How about I retort my displeasure and my surprise, again?" Ucal growled down at the shortest Regulator that was blocking his advancement to Igala and the forward buildings for some reason.

The Regulator lifted up from a pocket within the golden colored tunic and presented a palm-sized device without a smile and an emotion into the nose bridge of Igala. "Please select an environment!"

Ucal spun around in a circle and tossed both arms into the air with fury. "What's going on here? Why are we back here at Society City Four? We are supposed to be visiting Society City One. That is north of here, not south of there. What have we done, Regulator?"

The Regulator said to Igala and pointed down at the devise. "Please, select an environment."

I closed my eyelashes with a puff of nervousness, looking down with a sour frown and opened my eyeballs to see the rough concrete of the brick pavement and then the Regulator with a stern face, "Horses."

The Regulator looked down and tapped on the device without a smile. "The environment of horses has been accepted." It looked up without a smile to see Igala. "The Zulu Time Ball will begin at five in the afternoon. You are to be presentable and ready for your Regulator escort. Please, enjoy the music, food, and dance," the Regulator back stepped and spun around with a stern face, moving ahead and led Igala ahead. The two other Regulators on each side of Igala moved ahead in silence toward the double wooden doors of the Cee Building in silence also.

Ucal moved ahead and spun around in a backward motion with a grin and a wink to Igala in silence. Then, he swung around with a stern face and jogged ahead toward the middle building of old wooden that was decorated as a short and squat shaped courthouse. Both of the wooden doors opened for his heat signature. He entered and disappeared into the dark hallway.

Both the doors closed shut.

Cee Building location

Cold air temperature and the wall of dead bodies

Chamber suite of rooms setting

The lead Regulator stopped and stood in place. The set of doors automatically opened. The Regulator sidestepped from the entrance opening. The other two Regulators and Igala entered into the Cee Building of the criminals for Zulu Time.

I swiftly moved ahead from the two Regulators, strolling down the cold and white granite hallway in fear and angry. I was angry at some person and I also feared the same person.

Yeah, I knew why I was here at Zulu Time for the third time. However, I still couldn't believe it or accept it or whatever it.

I slightly led the pair of two Regulators and approached the set of closed glittering golden colored doors that entered into the long matching hallway of sleeping suites, where my parents were standing and worrying about Zulu Time.

The pair of suite doors parted for Igala.

The two Regulators stopped and stood inside the white granite tinted hallway without emotion, after escorting the criminal to the proper place.

I entered and strolled down the central hallway of the chamber suits, feeling the cold temperatures of the air, hearing the loud sound.

Her parents were loudly talking to the children with a set of laughs and giggles during the third visit to the Cee Building and inside the room for Zulu Time.

Her sister Laddie side stepped from her mom Henoana and ran forward with a smile, stopping and stood in front of her older sister Igala. She wore a tea lengthy dress of bows and lace in the color of mauve with a pair of matching shoes and matching wrist gloves. Her hair was fixed into a ponytail with an array of dots of different colors of green, pink, red, yellow, and orange. Her face was painted in mint green colored baby sea horses and played a gently soprano tone. "You look like a princess." She reached out and touched each bracelet on the arm of Igala with a giggle and a grin.

I slipped off one of the bracelets and handed it to my baby sister with a smile and in silence.

Her brother Segar spun around from the marble island and his dad Genic with a stern face and moved ahead, stopping and stood beside his baby sister with a sour frown at the long dress of Igala. He wore a pair of faded blue jeans, a new pair of new re-designer polished orange and purple tinted cowboy boots, and a short jacket of light brown over a slightly dirty T-shirt with a pair of white gloves. His face was decorated in red colored rabbit heads that squeaked when he talked. "There is not such a thing as a princess or a prince during the modern times within Society City Four..."

Her mom Henoana swung around from the marble island and her husband Genic with a smile, cupping both hands to a face, wearing an ankle-length gown of mauve with a pair of matching elbow length gloves and a pair matching sandals. Her hair was pulled back into a ponytail that was decorated colored in bright purple at the end of the ponytail. Her face whistled with a set of yellow colored duck heads. "Awe, you look beautiful like a princess. And you are wearing a complete set of glittering gem stones? Do you get to keep all the jewelry? What was the Tour of Zulu Time like? Did you meet new people? Is this one of your re-designer dresses? It is very pretty. Do you have more of them? Where is your luggage, Igala?"

Her father Genic spun around from the granite island and his mother Oltole with a smile and a nod, patting an empty stomach, moving ahead and stood in front of Igala. He wore a pair of faded and ripped with hole ancient blue jeans with a light brown sports jacket, a pair of white gloves, and a pair of new re-designer polished green and gray cowboy boots. "This is another special evening for the Smith family. We are going to attend the Zulu Time Ball for the third time. I really like the food trays. And I plan to eat good too. Will we see and meet Ucal tonight at the dance? Ucal likes you, Igala. Doesn't he, sweetheart? Are you and Ucal getting married after your Hall graduation, next week, honey?"

"Mama and Dad?" I exhaled with a puff of fear and worry. Her parents didn't understand the delicate and dangerous situation. I moved ahead and stopped, standing in front of the white tinted marble island, removing every piece of jewelry and rested each time on top of the smooth surface, before the start of the Zulu Time Ball with a sour frown.

Her family members spun around and moved ahead, stopping and surrounded Igala around the marble island also with a set of chuckles and smiles.

Henoana stood on the side of Igala and reached out, grabbing the emerald stoned tiara with a smile. "We should dress up in these gems for the dance. That would blow away our evil foes. Every one of us would like so pretty and so regal."

I reached down and touched the emerald forehead band that came from the forehead of my fiancé Dfee with a sob of worry. I did not want to remove the precious symbol of our eternal love from my wrist bone, but I didn't want Ucal to see and recognize the jewelry item and question me during the Zulu Time Ball. I needed his brave assistance of Tag inside the Bowl event again to save the lives of my biological family members for a third time from death.

Genic looked down with a worried brow to see each jewelry piece over the white marble stone. "No, dear. These pretty gems are not part of the Zulu Time event. I do not want to break any rules here inside Zulu Time. All the gem stones stay here on top of the island. We can collect them later after the dance and bring them back home after Zulu Time for safekeeping. Are all of those your gems to keep, Igala?"

"Yes," I caressed and finally removed the emerald forehead band from my waist bone with a worried brow and a worried heart, reaching out and placed the band on top of the heap of jewel items.

Henoana reached out and continued to lift up and examine each piece of jewelry with a smile and a nod of delight. "The gem stones are so beautiful."

"I want one, too, Mama." Laddie couldn't see the flat surface of the island and touched the side of the marble island with both hands with a smile.

Henoana lifted up the finger ring of pink stones and tried it her hand with a smile and a nod. "So beautiful, the gem stone shine is so brilliant. You did well during the Tour of Zulu Time. These gems are going to look so pretty with my new set of re-designer dresses. Only the extreme wealthy can display a set of lovely real gem stone jewelry with good taste and the latest fashion re-designer wardrobe like us, now. Is the Tour of Zulu Time finished for the day, Igala?"

"Don't..." know. But I guessed it was finished foreverly.

Segue stood between his father Genic and his sister Laddie, reaching out and grabbed a bracelet for his younger sister and lowered it, handing the item to her with a smile. "Here you go, Laddie!"

Laddie reached up both hands and grabbed the bracelet with a giggle and a grin, sliding off and on a tiny arm.

Segue reached out and grabbed the emerald forehead band of stones that Igala had received from Dfee, drawing the jewelry into a smile. "Wow, I like this one. I wanna..."

"Don't..." I reached out and touched that forehead band, turning with growl to see the black hair roots of my brother Segue with fury.

Henoana reached out and grabbed another finger ring with a smile and a nod, slipping over a second finger, "Igala, give me the collector bar, now! I will take it home with me for deposit into our coin account. Then, when you restart the tour, you can have an empty one."

Genic tossed both hands into the air and slapped them down over the hands of his son Segue with a sour frown. "Everyone, take off the jewelry, right now. The pair of Regulators will be coming any minute for us for the dance and dinner ball," he grabbed the forehead band of emeralds from Segue and lifted into in the air, dropping it back down into the heap of gems, reaching out and gently tapped the collar bone of Igala with a worried brow. "We need to be all ready for the Regulators. You need to paint on a set of brown colored raccoon eyes for the dance ball before you break a rule, Igala. Get going, now! We don't want any trouble here, not now. We follow the rules at all time within Society City Four."

I removed the last piece of jewelry and eyeballed the emerald forehead band with a puff of worry. "I know the procedure. Thanks for the update, Dad!" I back stepped and side stepped from the marble island, dashing ahead, dragging the dress hem over the dirty floor and moved down the long hallway into the bathroom.

Her grandmother Oltole back stepped and side stepped from the island and slowly turned and followed behind the back spine of her granddaughter with a worried brow and a worried heart.

Inside the Girl's Bathroom setting, I leaned over the wet sink and lifted up, painting a set of ugly brown color over each eye socket with the paint brush, which I had done two times before.

Oltole entered the bathroom and stopped, standing near the sink counter and stared at the nose profile of Igala with a stern face "What is going on here, Igala? Your mom is in love with the jewelry. Your father is in love with Ucal. Your siblings are having a good time fun within the tomb of the dead. And you are..."

"I don't know, Granny." I continued to paint the raccoon eye sockets on a face before the Regulators arrive and avoided the direct question from my grandmother.

She sneered. "Of course, you do. Do not joke with me! You are so calm but panicking inside your girly guts. How many girls was inside the car with you when you had that collision which rear- ended the expensive hover car?"

I exhaled and continued to paint my face. "Three."

She looked up with a worried brow to see the ceiling. "Merciful angels in heaven, that's mean that there will be one more Zulu Time for all of us." Oltole looked down with a worried brow to see the nose profile of Igala.

I encircled the brush around the eye socket, finishing up the raccoon eyes for the dancing ball and dropped the brush down into the wet sink with a sigh, staring at the raccoon eyeballs without crying. "I am going to fix it, Granny."

She exhaled with a fake smile. "Ucal is going to get us out, again. He has done this two other times. Thank goodness!"

"Yeah, I know." I exhaled with a puff of worry and stared into the mirror at the raccoon eyeballs that hid my worried brow.

She exhaled with a sour frown at the nose profile of Igala. "I know, too. I do not want to be present here inside Zulu Time ever, again, Igala."

"Yeah, I know that, too," I did not want to present inside Zulu Time, now.

She looked down with a stern face to see the wet floor and looked up with a fake smile to see the nose profile of Igala. "It will be okay, dear. It sounds like Ucal loves you and will protect your life..."

Segue stood outside the bathroom door with a yell to his grandmother and his sister with a smile. _"Come on, now!"_

Oltole slowly spun around with a stern face and exited the bathroom, slowly moving down the hallway, reaching out and grabbed the hand of Segue.

They swiftly moved down the hallway toward the front of the chamber suites, softly talking and giggling.

I back stepped from the mirror with a sour frown and a whisper. "It sounds like I saved us two times before twice." I turned to the side and dashed over the granite floor, seeing the action far ahead with a gasp.

The twin doors parted and opened with an escort of two Regulators.

The Smith family moved ahead and exited from the suite, strolling over the marble white floor with a set of chuckles and smiles of a new adventure.

Her father Genic escorted her mother Henoana out the doors first. Her grandmother Oltole held the hands of her sister Laddie and her brother Segue.

I slowly trailed behind the family unit with a worried brow for the third time into the Zulu Time dance hall, wearing the dull pink and dirty long gown from the Tour of Zulu Time. I felt like a trapped animal from decades ago when the vicious humans captured and caged innocent wild animals for fun and amusement.

I was a human, not an animal. However, I had lost my right of freedom through the false claims within Zulu Time. I hated the concept of Zulu Time. I wished so hard that I could shout and scream and then toss my body down over the floor, crying and cursing like a normal teen.

I could not.

Her parents would be embarrassed from the childish fit over the set of dirty tiles inside the Cee Building.

Two weeks ago, I had accidentally rammed the front of my ancient rolling four-wheeled automobile into the rear bumper of a new shiny hover vehicle on the Hall campus grounds. I was having some teenly fun, slowly driving around the curvy paved roadway inside the convertible with a set of my friends.

Then, her seventeen-year-old best friend and schooler mate Minki tattled on Igala at the Regulator headquarters that Minki had been involved in an automobile crash with another driver.

Minki showed up at Zulu Time tan colored room, wearing a set of colorful bandages over an arm, a neck, and a leg for drama. However, she ended up inside the Bowl with Igala instead, where all her biological family unit was killed by the Cee team of criminals that consisted of Igala and Ucal.

Now, one of the other schoolers from Hall, who was inside the ancient automobile of Igala, had tattled to the Regulator headquarters on the driver. Thus, the biological happy family unit of Igala was strolling back through the Cee Building to attend Zulu Time for a third time.

It was absolutely abnormal and impossible for a family unit to attend Zulu Time more than once. Always, one of the family units was found guilty by the audience membership of numerous and active tiny glass screens on the curved wall that held the entertainment program of Zulu Time. Then, the surviving family unit was very, very carefully about getting into any more trouble with a Regulator for a second time.

05:05 pm (early evening)

Warm temperatures with thunderstorms

Zulu Time Ball

The Smith family unit shoved and bumped into each other with happiness and glee, moving through the open archway as the open door was guarded and held open by a pair of two golden colored Regulators. The Smith family unit wandered through the scene of active dancers and settled down into a wall corner on top of one of many re-designer sofas. They were dressed in a fine attire of new re-designer clothing, compliments of Zulu Time. They were not worried or concerned about a Zulu Time attendance or a death judgment, since they loved and support a cute and hunky teen named Ucal, whose family was a pair of Regulators.

I stood inside the open archway of the dance hall, posing like a princess in the dull slightly dirty pink ankle-length gown with a worried brow and a tummy of pretend butterflies, since I was really guilty of ramming into the hover vehicle with the front bumper of my ancient automobile. Now, I needed to find and locate my schooler friend Ucal for his bravery, again.

Ucal was somewhere inside the dance hall, looking and watching for Igala, too. He would advise Igala, regarding the next step of Zulu Time.

The Regulator cleared a throat, signaling Igala to move inside and enter the dance hall to dance, to eat, or to plot.

I exhaled with a puff of nervousness and reached down, gathering the dress hem of the gown, moving ahead, wandering among the active dancers over the dance floor. I strolled away from my family unit, looking down with a worried brow at the floor for a pair of polished cowboy boots in aqua and black colors and then ran into the wall of sneers. I looked up with a gasp and a sneer. "Kallidin, you're on one of the victims on the Vee team."

Kallidin popped the blue colored bubble gum into the face of Igala, sucking it back into a pair of open lips, smashing the lips with a smirk and a giggle. "Yeah, you were always smart, Igala. Too bad, you won't live pass tonight to use your smart brain for tomorrow..."

"Profound line! I will remember and write it on the Wall of Memories tomorrow within the wet and colorful wattle and daub for bad memory, bitch."

She gasped with a sour frown. "You are dying, tonight."

I rolled my eyeballs with a laugh and looked back with a smile to see her frown, holding a stomach of fluttering butterflies with the lie. "That's great joke, dead girl pal," growling. "Since, I have survived two times with fine, dandy, alright."

She laughed. "Good luck always flees and fails at the last moment."

I winked with a grin. "Another profound line, thanks for all the flamboyance sentence structures on your memory..."

Ucal rushed forward from the food table and stood behind the buttonhole of Kallidin with a smile and a chuckle. "What could you, two pretty girls be gossiping about over here in the middle of the dance floor? Could it be me?" He side stepped and moved ahead, reaching out, man-pulling Igala into a chest, wearing a silly colored rose-tinted sports jacket with a pair of torn and ripped re-designer blue jeans, and a pair of polished aqua and black cowboy boots.

"We are discussing future moments of past dead memories. Right, girl pal?" Kallidin swung around with a smile and moved ahead with a laugh, meeting a group of tall males that wore the same silly raccoon eyes and a pair of new re-designer blue jeans.

I turned with a sneer and burned a set of invisible red colored fireballs into her buttonhole with a sigh. "Now, I know the reason for my criminal status, again. Kallidin was inside the car with me."

He was a tall teen male with head of cropped dark brown hair, a tone of yellow tinted skin, a pair of light mint green eyeballs, a face of brown dusted whiskers, and a pair of rippled muscles, wearing a pair of ripped and faded non-re-designer blue jeans, a dirty white non-re-designer T-shirt, a pair of dirty and unpolished cowboy boots of brown and black, and an aqua tinted sports jacket with a pair of matching gloves. Dfee dashed from the one of the entrance doors with a sour frown and a set of raccoon eyeballs, stopping and stood next to the nose profile of Ucal with fury. "What the fu...fudge is going on here, Ucal?"

Ucal swung around with a sneer at his childhood best pal. "What's your probe, bro?"

Dfee frowned. "My probe is a Regulator up my jeans. I was hauled and hog-tied here by my parents and a set of two Regulators and then delivered like a criminal or something."

I held onto the two hands of Ucal for dancing with a puff of worry, staring at the nose profile of Dfee. "Join my nightmare!"

Ucal reached out and touched the silk jacket of Dfee with a smile. "I like your cute aqua tinted dinner jacket. It matches both of your pretty eyeballs, bro. Look, me and her got the same treatment." He turned with a confused brow. "Why did you pick...?"

"Me," Kallidin stepped between the nose profiles of Ucal and Dfee and popped the blue bubble, sucking it back into her parted lips with a giggle and a grin.

Dfee back stepped with a sour from both Ucal and Kallidin with a sour frown. "Go to hell, Kallidin!"

Kallidin back stepped from the huddle of Ucal, Dfee, and Igala with a laugh and a wink at Igala. "Been there, don't like it. So, I have returned." She swung around and danced side to side in the black colored halter dress, moving toward her family members.

Dfee turned and sneered at the butthole of Kallidin. "What the fudge is going on here? The Cee team can identify us within the dance."

Ucal back stepped from Igala and turned with a stern face, dashing ahead with a yell to the wall with a row of Regulators. "I want to see Regulator 1990, now."

I turned and frowned at Dfee. "I didn't know they were numbered."

"Me, either," Dfee turned and frowned at the back spine of Ucal and the wall of Regulators which occupied every single space, spinning around with a smile and moved in front of Igala, wrapping both arms around her waist, swaying side to side with the dance music.

I turned and sneered at his nose bridge. "Don't you dare kiss me in here! I have to fight for my parents to live and survive Zulu Time for the third time. I'm not in the mood. I'm scared to death, this time."

"I'm not going to kiss you, beauty." He chuckled. "Dang, how many girls were inside that old Cad?"

"Her..."

"Enough!" Ucal had returned and stopped, standing beside the nose profile of Dfee with a sneer. "Move over, redneck. Me and Igala need to dance, now," he reached out and grabbed the gloved hand of Igala, turning them to the side, dragging her from Dfee and onto a different part of the dance floor. He spun around with a sour frown and a whisper into her nose bridge. "You need to call Tag Team, today." He swayed side to side like a fun dance.

I swayed side to side with his rhythm and exhaled with fury, turning to see the black dress hem of Kallidin inside the far wall corner. She stood with a gang of tall males on the other side of the room, watching Igala with a sneer. I turned and exhaled into his nose bridge. "I can hear her sneer. This is getting redundancy ridicule silly."

He exhaled with a huff of worry into her eyeballs. "This ain't silly, but it is redundant. You are going back into Zulu Time for a third time."

My eyeballs darted up and stared into his worried eyeballs. "I didn't do anything wrong here."

He exhaled. "Yes, you did. You drove around a bunch of silly teenage girls inside the back seat of your as silly teen, too."

"I..."

"I know, too. Don't worry. This is going to be over and done, very fast."

"Wait! Are both of your parents involved in this Zulu Time thing, too?"

"No..." he back stepped with a grunt and swung around with a sour frown from Igala, moving toward the food table. He had danced with Igala long enough and didn't want to alert the Regulators of his conspicuous plan with the Smith family, even thou his mom had suspected.

Dfee stood beside the food table and sipped on the beverage, without messing up the raccoon eyeballs, staring at the back spine of Ucal, who was leaving Igala alone on the dance floor. He moved ahead with a smile and slammed into her cheekbone with a chuckle, "Hey, beauty! What are you so sad? This is a dance which is fun and happy."

I turned and stared at the back spine of Ucal with a confused brow. He stopped and stood in front of the food table, reaching out for a beverage. I turned and frowned at Dfee. "Ucal is mad at me, the world, and his life."

Dfee smiled into the cheekbone of Igala, not caring about the feelings of Ucal. "Why is he mad? I toured all the Society Cities with you and him. I had a good time fun..."

I exhaled. "Ucal had the company of misery with a bad time on the silly Tour of Zulu Time. He couldn't get anyone to hear his practiced speech about Zulu Time or the Tag or the whatever. He was mad and angry all the time, not eating or drinking or bathing or dancing or swimming. He didn't dance one song with me at..."

"I danced with you inside the flowers of meadows, the warm oceans of fishes, and the cool damp cave. I don't like the underground cavern with a musical band and dance music. It is too closed in. My sinuses were scared."

I laughed, "You didn't act scared, Dfee."

"I was. I had to dance really close to you to keep my sinuses and my heart inside my body. You make my body warm and happy."

I smiled. "You make..."

"Yes, I do."

I exhaled. "What about the Zulu Time? I go in..."

"A few more minutes, so that leaves us a few more seconds." He leaned over and barely kissed her lips, pulling back with a wink and a whisper. "Ucal told you to call Tag Team, right?"

"Yes, what does that mean?"

The gong sounded with a deep dong.

Jamie and Jackie twirled around and around in two individual circles, moving ahead from the entrance door, occupying the middle of the dance floor with a hand microphone and a smile, saying in unison. "Ladies and gentlemen, the Zulu Time Ball has concluded."

Jamie stopped the whirl with a smile to see the dancers. "Thank you for coming out to attend the nightly event."

Jackie stopped the twirl with a smile to see the dancers. "Please, drive home safely. Have a good trip. Goodnight to all."

Dfee whispered into her nose bridge with a mint breath and a grin. "Call out, Tag Team. See you, later, gator. Do you like my new rhyme? I make it up when the salty alligator tried to eat my foot during our hot passion love making on top of the wet sandbar inside Society City Two."

I giggled. "Geez, you lie so much."

"Dwit, Dfun, Dfit, Dfee, that's me." He back stepped with a chuckle and spun around from her with a smile, dashing ahead through the crowd of dancers, running into the butthole of Ucal with a chuckle.

Ucal swung around with a stern face and a nod, spinning around from Dfee, leading both them through the open archway and into the dark hallway out of sight.

I stood in place on the dance floor in worry, defeat, sadness, angry, fury, and coldness. A hand reached up and touched the collar bone of Igala. I gasped with a whisper.

He grandmother Oltole moved and stood behind the cheekbone of Igala with a stern face. "We need to go back to the Cee suites. I guess you were talking to Ucal in that silly disguise. That was clever of him to wear a set of raccoon eyelids, too. What did he say?"

I stared into the darkness of the open archway with a worried brow and a worried heart. "The usual, I must call out Tag..."

"The same thing, you and he are going to fight inside the Bowl for a second time."

I exhaled with a puff of more worry. "I guess, Granny."

She patted the collar bone of Igala with a smile and a nod. "You will win for a second time. Ucal is a strong male. He will make a fine husband for you, Igala. You know that, too."

I nodded in silence. My life was about to go into a battle again for a second life of love and happiness. All my grandmother could smile about was cute Ucal and his strength and his bravery, since he wanted to be a Regulator. These were very good traits for a Regulator. And Ucal would make a fine husband for her granddaughter Igala. I watched the open archway of darkness on the other side of the side wall and whispered for my eardrums only. "I don't wanna be a Regulator." I exhaled with a puff of worry. "I have been away from my home too long. I miss my home. I wanna go back to my home."

Her grandmother Oltole reached down and patted the arm of Igala with a smile. "You will. Ucal will come and straighten this out a second time like always." She back stepped and strolled ahead with her daughter-in-law Henoana, leaning over with a whisper of secret words, moving over the dance floor and into the hallway.

I moved ahead over the dance floor and stared at the back spines of my family members and the row of Regulators that were escorting the criminals back toward the suite and turned to see each Regulator on the side wall that was guarding the wall for some reason. There were numerous Regulators present here inside the dance hall, tonight.

Genic hugged his son Segue and his daughter Laddie with a smile into the rib cage, leading his family back down the creepy but pretty hallway of marble, following behind a row of four different back spines of golden tinted Regulators in silence.

I did not show any type of facial or body language. I was entering into the Bowl arena for a second time to stop the death sentence of my family unit.

The parents of Igala were healthy and fit people, but her younger brother Segue and her baby sister Laddie could not fight inside the Bowl with another teenager of equal or greater than her body size, since the option would be played out tonight inside Zulu Time.

The Regulators turned the wall corner and another wall corner, marching over the smooth white tinted marble floor, stopping in front of a pair of two glittering golden tinted doors of the Cee chamber suite of rooms.

Genic, Segue, and Laddie stopped and waited at the closed doors. Oltole and Henoana stopped behind the back spines of Genic, Segue, and Laddie, still whispering with a set of secret words.

I slowed and halted beside the back spine of my grandmother.

The golden doors automatically opened without any type of mechanic or an electronic ray from one of the lenses of the sunglasses or a fingertip on the golden glove of the regulator. Therefore, none of the Smith family members were permanently locked inside the Cee chamber suite of rooms until Zulu Time at seven pm.

06:06 pm (early evening)

Warm temperatures with light rain

Cee chamber rooms

The four Regulators split into pairs and moved backward, standing against each side wall, creating a set of four angel shadow figures. The Smith family advanced ahead into the cold and pretty chamber suite and stopped in front of the marble island in the middle of hallway, waiting for another miracle act from the seventeen-year-old Ucal, schooler of Igala.

Henoana reached out and touched each set of hair roots of her younger children with a smile and a nod. "Laddie and Segue, go and run down into the bathrooms."

"Sure." Segue dashed ahead down the hallway toward the bathroom with a smile.

"Okay." Laddie ran behind the back spine of her brother with a smile.

Henoana nodded with a smile and a yell, standing in front of the marble island. "We all need to wash off the raccoon eyeballs while we watch for the new racks of wardrobe to change into our new clothing for Zulu Time. I hope that the re-designer dresses are better quality, this round. Now, I need to find a certain fashion style that makes my figure look good." She spun around with a sour frown to stare at the closed doors of the suite with a puff of annoyance, parking both fists on the re-designer gown. "Where are the Regulators? They can't be late. Then, we won't have enough time to pick out and change into our new re-designer gowns. What color shall we wear for the evening, Oltole? Do you have a good idea of the color theme for tonight, Genic?"

Genic burped with a chuckle and patted the stomach with a grin. "Sorry. The food is really good here. I think I'm full and filled with too much good food. I don't care about the color theme for the night, dear. I'll go and help Segue wash off his raccoon eyeballs and mine, too." He back stepped from the marble island with a smile and slowly strutted down the long hallway with a grin and another burp of good food.

The twin doors parted and separated. Two racks of clothing floated in the air and landed on each side of the wall inside the Cee suite. Then, the twin doors closed and shut.

Henoana moved ahead with a smile to the rack of female clothing, stopping and stood at the beginning of the rack with a sour frown. She scooted each hanger to the side with a swish sound. "Yuck. Ugly. Horrible. Terrible. Ugh. All of these re-designer dresses are so not me and so tacky. My wardrobe closet contains much better superior re-designer dresses. Well, I should have brought my own re-designer wardrobe with me to Zulu Time." She reached over and pulled out two dresses with a sour frown and a sissy whine. "I kinda like the color of rose, but I like the dress design of the olive green. Which set of re-designer dresses do you like, Igala, the rose or the olive green?" She spun around with a smile and wiggled both dresses in the air at Igala.

I swung around to face the first sleeping chamber with a sour frown and a soft timber. "I am not picky, Mom. I'm going to rest for a little while before the hour of Zulu Time."

Henoana smiled at the back spine of Igala with a nod. "Alright, honey, I like your pink evening dress. It is so regal and so pretty with the long train and open back panel. You should wear that dull pink colored dress into Zulu Time. Yes, we all will wear the color of dull pink. It will make the other people so jealous that we are so bold to look so different and exciting while not facing death," she swung around with a laugh and a smile, reaching over, selecting the dresses in the tone of dull pink.

I marched ahead with a worried brow and a worried heart, slamming a hand into the metal door on my new chamber room.

The door opened.

I moved inside and stopped, standing at the side of bed mattress. A stack of my old clothes were neatly folded on top of the bedcovers, looking dead. I exhaled with a puff of worry. I was going into Bowl arena for the second time. I wanted to be going home for the first time in a couple of days.

I worried about Dfee. He could not help me within Zulu Time. But I didn't worry about Ucal. He wanted to marry me.

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance. If Ucal saved my life again, then I must marry him for both respect and honor of my saved live. I whispered for my eardrums only. "I didn't wanna be a Regulator. I didn't like the golden skin or the pair of golden eyeballs with the pair of sunglasses."

I reached out and slammed the bedcovers and the pile of my clothing. My com-d wrist watch tumbled over the bedcovers. I reached out and grabbed the com-d with a smile, feeling part of my person.

For the past days, I wasn't my real person. I was a pretend person, a princess of Zulu Time. When I was with Dfee, I was my real person.

Now, I was my real person. I wanted to scream, yell, cry, and sob with angry and hurt. I wanted to see Dfee, again. I wanted to run away with Dfee and leave Zulu Time, my parents, Ucal, and Society City Four.

The sound of a knock echoed through the room.

I jumped with a pretend heart attack and spun around with a gasp.

The door opened. The face of Henoana peeked around the corner with a smile and a whistle of ugly puke green colored duck heads. "It is time. The Regulators are here."

"Yes ma'am," I nodded with a stern face.

She back stepped from the closing door.

I moved ahead with a worried brow and a worried heart, slapping the com-d over a waist which was a part of me. I didn't care if it was illegal or wrong. I slammed open the door with a hand and strolled from the suite and through the hallway.

The suite doors were parted open.

At 06:55 pm (early evening) inside the Cee hallway setting, her family members moved ahead and strolled over the white marble in three lines.

I dashed through the archway with a gasp.

Her father Genic was holding the tiny hand of his youngest daughter Laddie in the first line. Genic never held the hand of his daughters. He was leaning down and whispering into the ear of Laddie, making her giggle out loud. Her mom Henoana was the mother and acted with the motherly concern. That was very odd to see.

The second line was her mom Henoana was swinging the hand of her son Segue. She was reaching over and ticking the belly of her son with a smile and a giggle. Her son was laughing and dancing side to side from the fun event. Again, Segue was always walking between the boot toes of his father Genic. This was again a set of very different behavior patterns.

Her grandmother moved in the third line alone which was another usual scene. Throughout the young lives of the children, her grandmother Oltole provided the mental and social supports, since the parents of Igala worked during the day and performed home chores during the evening hours.

I swiftly moved too caught up behind the back spines of my family members, smiling at the happy moment right before Zulu Time. I had never seen my parents and my siblings in a happy mood like this before. I could see that each family member wore a dull pink color that sorta matched my dirty evening gown.

Genic turned the corner wall with a smile within the black colored raccoon eyes and stepped over the wooden floor in a silly pink colored sports jacket over a pair of faded non-re-designer blue jeans and a pair of polished red and brown cowboy boots.

Laddie skipped beside her father and wore a tea-length dress of pretty pink with bows and lace, a pair of wrist gloves, and a pair of pink shoes.

Henoana wore an ankle-length pink tinted dress, a pair of matching gloves and foot sandals, holding the hand of the silly pink colored sports jacket on Segue.

Oltole followed behind in an old fashioned high collar pink lace dress with a set of matching gloves and flat sandals, also.

In the Zulu Time Building inside the Cee team hallway, Genic and Laddie entered through the archway first, following behind the back spine of one Regulator, passing a set of glass cages, where the other criminal families were huddled together inside a glass cage, whispering about a defense strategy.

I didn't know if there really was a true strategy to winning Zulu Time, saving my guilty life, since an outside audience of invisible voices acted as the judge, the jury, and the executioner of just and justice.

Laddie continued to skip side to side, without fear and with giggles, rudely finger pointing at each cage of entrapped families, who wear a set of pretty clothing and a set of painted faces. Her happy behavior was a contrast to the second time inside Zulu Time, when she cried and held onto her mom's hand.

The father of Igala, Genic strutted like a king with a smile over the black colored carpet, without a care in the world and turned to see with a puzzled brow all the glass cages.

Each glass cage was full of two or three individual. The presentation of additional bodies made the Zulu Time event very different, today. Genic wasn't worry. He trusted the young seventeen-year-old Ucal, the son of his former best friend.

Ucal would fight inside the Bowl arena for the life of Igala for a second time. He was a strong and brave teen, who would make an excellent husband for Igala. His elder daughter continued to make too many mistakes that could cost her life.

Henoana and Segue moved ahead with a set of smiles and giggles, marching behind the back spine of her husband.

Segue skipped side to side and reached out to tap a hand smear mark on some of the glass cages like a misbehaving child with a laugh and a smile. He was intrigued with Zulu Time, spending time on the com-d, reading about the complicated event. And he wasn't scared of the Zulu Time hostesses or the members of the Vee team like he was last time during the first visit inside Zulu Time. He had done nothing wrong, since it was his sister Igala that had wrecked the ancient car and caused the family unit to appear in Zulu Time.

Henoana turned and stared at the pitiful fools inside the glass cages, who would probably die on the tan colored wall of Zulu Time tonight for some silly reason. She had overconfidence in Ucal, who would soon be the husband of her daughter Igala.

After the Tour of Zulu Time finally completed, Igala would be eighteen years old. She would marry Ucal and live as a housewife and become a future mother without working a re-gen job, which was a rare breed within Society City Four.

Oltole waddled behind the back spines of Henoana and Segue with a stern face turning to see each glass cage of criminals without a vocal word or a finger motion.

I continued to stare inside each glass cage without a facial expression. The cages were very full tonight. I felt sadness and remorse. The Cee team criminals usually didn't win the Zulu Time justification case.

07:00 pm

Warm temperatures with light rain

Zulu Room location glass cage setting of the Smith family

The Regulator stopped and turned to the side, leaning over and tapped with a glove finger onto the slender glass door. The door opened.

Genic swept down and picked up Laddie into both arms with a smile, turning and carried her into the empty glass cage that was assigned to the Smith family.

Henoana stopped and stood in place, allowing Segue to move inside before here. She turned and followed behind his back spine. Segue moved ahead and angled to the wall corner, sitting down on the floor.

Oltole slowly turned and moved inside the glass cage with a sour frown at the Regulator for capturing her biological family for the third time without an explanation of the crime.

I slowly turned with a worried brow and a worried heart, feeling sad for my secret fiancé Dfee, wringing both hands in nervousness. I, not my family members, was entering the Bowl arena, again. I stopped and stood a few feet from the glass door.

The door closed and entrapped the Smith family for a second time inside the glass cage.

Genic stopped and stood in front of the wall of glass that was illuminated in rows of silver and golden lines, holding Laddie with one bicep. Zulu Time had not started. It was a few seconds shy of the seventh hour of the evening. He reached up and tapped the glass. A vertical line in red colors appeared onto the glass.

I gasped at the red line on the wall of glass.

Oltole slowly swung around to see the other glass cages that showed the other criminal families that would participate in Zulu Time, tonight. She was older in age but did recognize a familiar face or two inside one of the glass cages with a gasp and a confused brow. Then she spun around to see the surprised expression on her granddaughter Igala, moving ahead and stood beside Igala and stared at the wall of glass.

I stared at the vertical red line on the wall of glass.

Genic tapped on the top of the red line, sending the color of red down to the end point. Then the wall of glass turned into a very dull blackish color.

I stared at the blackish colored wall of glass with a gasp and a confused brow.

Oltole leaned over with a smile and a whisper into the cheekbone of Igala as she was the same height. "Did you know the wall of glass could be darkened?"

I gasped. No. How did he do that? How did he know to do that?"

"The newer wall of glass model allows for child protection. Thus, the screen can be darkened by the guardian, where the control switch is located at the top of the wall unit."

"How did he know to do that?"

She smiled. "You have missed much, Igala. The house has a set of newer glass wall models. My son learned to do that from the instruction tip, of course."

I continued to watch with a stern face my father Genic. "I have missed much. What does that statement mean?"

She watched her son Genic with a smile. "The Smith family received the remaining assets from the first Vee team family. It was that teen boy you hit and didn't kill with the front bumper of your ancient rolling vehicle."

"Yeah, I remember."

She nodded with a smile. "Nice stuff, too. Yeah, the stuff was much nicer than the material assets from Minki and her dead family members."

I gasped. "What does that mean, too?"

She smiled. "You have been gone for a long time, Igala."

I looked down with a confused brow to see the glass floor with a gasp and looked up to see her cheekbone. "I have been gone for three days. What does that mean, Granny?"

"You will not recognize your own home. The living room has been expanded out and made to be more comfortable. And there is a separate play room for Laddie. The kitchen is the same, thou. There are six new robots with assigned duties of cooking, cleaning, yard working, teaching, and other human chores. You have a new wall of glass inside your room like the rest of the family. I don't want a wall of glass, thou. Your room has a set of new re-designer furniture, coming from one of the dead people's house..."

"Don't!" I exhaled. "Please, don't call the new furniture, coming from the dead people's house..."

She giggled. "It is true, Igala."

I exhaled. "What else is new?"

She smiled. "My son Genic is spending more time with Laddie. Look at them in the far corner wall!"

I turned and stared with a confused brow at Genic and Laddie, hearing the precious moment.

Genic sat against the wall of glass and blocked the view of the next glass walls, so his daughter would not see the activity inside Zulu Time in a few more seconds. He leaned down with a smile and counted on her fingers with a chuckle. "What is three plus three, honey?"

Laddie counted out loud on each finger. "One, two, three, four, five, six..." she looked up with a smile to see her father.

Oltole smiled. "He has been teaching her to count and to add, helping her to read."

I smiled. "That is amazing."

"Look at the other wall corner! Your mom and my grandson Segue are spending some serious bonding time."

I turned with a smile to see my mom and my brother in silence. Henoana was leaning down and tickling the body parts of her son with a loud giggle.

Oltole exhaled. "Segue stays inside his bedroom day and night, watching the wall of glass for school and for socializing. He doesn't come down to eat, either. The newly acquired food bot brings up a tray of hot steaming food. He enjoys his time alone, talking and interacting with his old and new cyberspace friends, now days. This is the first time that I have seen his body within two days."

I gasped. "What?"

She exhaled. "It is nice that your mom is spending time with her son. I haven't seen you mom in three days..."

"What?" I gasped, again.

"She spends all day and all night shopping at the Re-gen Mall, buying all kinds of new re-gen merchandise for the house. The house is so pretty. You will not recognize your own home."

"You are repeating your sentences." I frowned.

"Your mom is spending her quality time with her son. That is amazing!"

"Everything has changed." I frowned with sadness with some of the newest news of my family unit.

Oltole turned with a smile to see the nose profile of Igala. "You have not changed, Igala. You are strong and brave, since the beginning of this Zulu Time nonsense. Are you worried about the Bowl for the second time, again?"

Henoana stood with a smile and straightened out the new re-designer gown with a sour frown, turning with a stern face, moving ahead to Oltole and Igala and stopped, standing at the nose bridge of Igala. She extended an open palm with a smile. "Give me the collector bar, now, Igala!"

Oltole turned and smiled at Henoana. "Where will you keep it, Henoana?"

Henoana frowned. "In my hand..."

I slapped both hands down over the dull pink and dirty silk dress with a gasp. "The collector bar is located inside the tiny pouch that is located near my thigh, Mama. I would have to lift up the skirt and expose my leg..."

"It is only your leg, Igala." Henoana frowned.

Oltole smirked at Henoana. "Then you would have to lift up your dress and expose your fifty-year-old pale tinted and wrinkly older leg to place the collector bar inside the tiny pouch of your re-designer gown to the other people inside the glass cages. The bar can't contain sweat molecules or droplets of water. Then it won't work."

Henoana gasped. "I do not want to expose my leg to the other nasty criminals inside the Zulu Time hallway."

"Either, does Igala." Oltole elbowed with a smirk and a nod on Igala.

Henoana gasped and then smiled. "Alright, please give me the collector bar after Zulu Time, Igala."

"Yes ma'am." I faked a smile and continued to stand in front of glass door inside the assigned glass cage, fidgeting with the long dirty skirt of the gown, turning to see the wall of glass inside the other glass cage next to our cage glass without audio sound. It didn't matter. I could see the action and figure out the deadly consequences.

Her father Genic had darkened the wall of glass and blacked out the activity of the Zulu Time exhibition inside the glass cage, choosing to play with her younger daughter on the glass floor instead.

07:07 pm (early evening)

Zulu Time room setting

The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness, "Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!"

A set of two doors opened on each side of the curved tan colored wall inside the interior room of Zulu Time, marking the beginning of the program for all wall of glass inside each home within Society City Four.

A pale skinned female exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female exited from the other side door as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jaime and Jackie Jones."

Jackie twirled around in a tight circle with a smile to see each tiny black colored glass screen, wearing a short A-line light blue colored dress with multiple zigzags of patterns, a pair of thigh high boots of black, and a pair of black colored hand gloves. Her pale face, a neck, and a naked collar bone were painted in a set of outlined cute baby foot imprints with a set of five toes in the color of purple. Her blonde hair was pulled back into a long ponytail, swaying side to side in painted circles of green, red, blue, and yellow colors. "I am Jackie. Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice. We will explain the rules for any new audience viewers. When an injustice has occurred, each party is presented here at the Zulu Time Building."

Jamie swirled around in a tight circle with a smile in a strapless short dress in hot pink colors, a pair of thigh high boots of black, and a pair of black colored elbow-length gloves. Her dark skin shined in a set of solid painted baby rattles over numerous body parts, including a face, a neck, both back shoulder blades, and a collar bone of varied colors, consisting of pink and blue. Her long black colored hair was piled on top of her hair roots in the colors of pink, green, red, yellow, and white. "I am Jamie. Then each party is allowed to voice their justification case within a twenty-second time period in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your supper time meal. After twenty seconds has ended, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for the criminal or the letter of V for the victim."

Each female spun around with a smile and moved back to a closed door on the opposite wall.

The Cee team door slid open first.

Jaime swung away from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of two people in front of a low and long bench of soft tan colored fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a smile, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of candy pink color. Each face was decorated in a set of colorful outlines of a single pink and yellow fireball geometric figure.

The Vee team door slid open next.

Jackie spun around from the open archway with a smile, leading a single person in front of the same bench and stopped. The single person stared ahead at the opposite party, shaking a skull with a sour frown in silence, wearing a dull dark brown business suit without the face paint and a pair of hand gloves.

Jamie and Jackie spun around and met in middle with a smile, twirling in a set of tight circles with a hand wave to see each glass screen.

Jackie stopped the whirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the solo member of the Vee team in the color of dark brown. My twin sister Jamie stands behind the Cee team. The Vee team claims that young couple refuses to change the name of the baby. The baby name is Re-gen with a dash between the letters E and G, also. He is here to address the issue and to educate that as a set of new parents, you cannot use silly and ridicule names. That silly or ridicule name will mar the baby for life. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice their individual justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty-second time period. Since each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jaime stopped the twirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod to each glass screen, holding the microphone. "I am Jaime. I stand behind the Cee team, who is a new family with an infant baby in the precious color of candy pink. It is important to remember which party you are rooting for in this justification case. You have twenty seconds to state your justification case to the viewers of Society City Four."

Jackie turned with a smile and handed the microphone to the elderly adult male of the Vee team as her sister Jamie turned and handed her microphone to the young adult male of the Cee team. They back stepped away from the bench and the two debating teams, stopping and stood against a small spot on the curved wall between the rows of tiny black glass screens. Each tiny black screen was six inches long by six inches wide that contained a face of a registered viewer, who owned a com-d or a communication devise to see and hear the world, especially the world of Society City Four.

Jackie and Jaime stared at the nose profile of each team member, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The young father of the Cee team wore an oversized pink colored tuxedo on his slender frame with a pair of white colored gloves and a matching bowtie. His face showed a single red and yellow fireball on each cheekbone. He lifted an arm into the air with a sour frown and a matching tone, saying with a sour tone into the microphone. "I don't know why I am here. I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't murder a person. I didn't kick a pet. I didn't run into another hover car. I didn't steal any type of merchandise. I didn't lie to my mama. I don't understand. I'm employed with a good job and pay all my outstanding invoices. I have a pretty wife and a beautiful baby. Why are my wife and I here inside the Zulu Time room?"

The second person of the Cee team, the mother wore an ankle-length pink gown with a pair of long white gloves, and a pink and yellow vertical flaming fire whirl on each cheekbone. She held the baby. The baby wore a pink dress and a pink blanket with a tiny single red and yellow fireball on each cheekbone. The mother of the baby leaned over with a smile into the microphone. "I am confused, too. I have given birth to my baby three days ago. This is our little daughter. Her name is Re-gen."

The elderly male of the Vee team wore an ancient looking brown business suit, instead of the fancy tuxedo with a head of gray colored hair without the face paint, saying with a sad face into the microphone. "You cannot name your baby, Re-gen. I told you inside my business office, where I record all the new baby names. You cannot name your baby, Re-gen. I told you that it is not recorded anywhere. Your baby does not have a name."

The father of Cee team jabbed a finger with a sneer at the elderly man of the Vee team. "Hey, I can name my kid anything that I want. This is my kid. I will raise and take care of my kid, not you. I am responsible for her well-being, not you. Thus, her name is Re-gen."

The mother of the baby on the Cee team smiled into the microphone. "We like that name, Re-gen."

The elderly man of the Vee team shook a skull with a stern face. "You cannot name the baby, Re-gen. It is against the law to name an infant a silly or an inappropriate name. This is why I had to report you, young stupid couple of little newborn to the Regulators."

The room went black as the voices of the two people went silent.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The twenty second deadline has expired."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only."

The voice of Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl."

The voices of Jackie and Jamie said with a smile within the darkness. "The voting is finished. Please illuminate all the glass screens now here inside Zulu Time."

All the tiny glass screens showed a black back ground with one single letter in white.

The voice of Jamie gasped within the darkness, seeing all the letters on the glass screens. "O dear, do you see, Jackie?

The voice of Jackie gasped within the darkness, seeing the illuminated television screens. "O dearest, yes, I see more, Jamie?"

The voice of the young mother from the Cee team shouted within the darkness and sobbed with tears, "My baby is only three days old."

The voice of Jackie exhaled with a puff of sadness within the darkness. "Quiet, please. You are not allowed to speak here."

The voice of Jamie exhaled with a puff of sadness within the darkness. "The highest number wins the justification case here tonight. The highest amount is the letter V for the victim team."

The tiny lights from the millions of glass screens went black. The dark room echoed in a series of loud screams and harsh curses plus the sounds of soft rips and tears of fabric. Then, the room was silent.

A few seconds later, all the overhead lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room, again.

On the forward wall, there were three objects that stood in height from tallest down towards shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages from the hair roots down to the pinky toes. There was a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull which hid the eyeballs, the lips, the nose holes, the ear holes, and the colored hair roots of the individual. However, the object could breathe through the sticky tape.

In front of the continuous low sitting bench of soft fabric that was mounted from wall-to-wall, the solo male of the Vee team stood and stared at the wall of three criminals, shaking a skull with a sour frown in silence.

Jackie did not twirl around to see each black screen with a sad face in the cute short dress. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, the Vee team must participate and accept the judgment of the citizens of Society City Four. Thus, the Cee team has lost the justification case here tonight. Now, each Cee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of beige and the pretty color of red against the forward wall for the true justice of the Cee team. Each Cee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment too. Thus, Cee team is sentenced to death."

Jamie did not swirl around to see each screen with a sad face in her cute short dress. "Vee team, please select your pleasure. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. There is an array of guns, an assortment of big to small knives, a box of arrow with a bow, and some nasty looking pick axes with deadly spikes and other types of punishment lethal items. This part of Zulu Time is the choice of the winning team. The only rule is that the solo Vee team member must fire one weapon at each oval shaped object and must hit and kill each oval shaped object anywhere on the tan or red tape on the forward wall of criminals."

The elderly male of the Vee team reached down and slapped the lid. The lid opened and lifted into the air. He shook a skull with a sour frown in silence and bent down over the cabinet, grabbing and lifted up a hand gun. He slapped the soft fabric. The lid closed and shut. He stood with both boot toes apart and shook a skull with a sour frown in silence. He pointed the cold barrel at the first and largest tan and red object on the wall of criminals.

Each criminal was flinging arms and legs up and down, hitting the wall with a set of violence movements sounding like a ghost with a series of soft moans and groans. The smallest object was wiggling side to side, crying inside the tan and red colored tape, flinging tiny arms over the air from a tiny body.

Jamie did not twirl and said with a sad face. "There are three members from the Cee team on the wall of criminals. The Vee member knows what to do with the gun."

Jackie did not swirl and said with a sad face. "Let's go, Jackie! A regulator is required in this Zulu Time activity. The Regulator will issue a set of earplugs and check off the safety latch on the hand gun."

Each female slowly turned with a sad face and slowly moved to the side door on the opposite wall into the open door.

A single Regulator moved from the victim side door, stopping and standing beside the solo Vee team member, handing out the pair of earplugs and checked the safety gun off. Then the Regulator spun around and left the Zulu Time room, moving back into the criminal side door. A Regulator was always dressed in a one-piece jumpsuit of coppery golden color that matched their skin tone and golden bald head of absent hair, serving as a peacemaker of each Society City.

Jackie and Jaime spun around and stood in the opposite archway and out of the way, saying in unison with a sad face and a soft tone into each microphone in unison. "Aim high."

They back stepped and moved into the dark tunnel for safety and protection.

Both the doors closed shut and tight.

The elderly male of the Vee team shook a skull with a sour frown in silence, holding the barrel at the first and largest object of tan and red colored tape on the forward wall, pressing the trigger. A red colored blaze of bullets released from the gun and hit the first object on the forward wall.

Each tan and red colored taped on the first and largest oval object on the wall of criminals turned into the color of rich black. The first and largest object stilled in death.

He scooted over and aimed at the second object on the forward wall, pressing the trigger for a second time. A cascade of red colored fire discharged and hit multiple parts of the tan and red colored tape. The tape colors turned into rich black hues.

The second object on the wall of criminals slammed both arms and legs against the wall in death.

He scooted to the third object on the forward wall in silence.

The baby wiggled side to side and cried through the tan and red colored tape with distress.

He shook a skull with a sour frown and parted the boot toes, lifting and aimed the smoking barrel of the heated hand gun at the tiny and smallest wiggling oval shaped object on the forward wall, pressing the trigger. Three bullets fired and hit the red colored chest cavity of the third object on the forward wall.

The last and smallest object on the wall of criminals, the baby stopped moved and stood pose on the wall like a framed picture in rich black colors.

The room went black.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said within the darkness. "It is done."

The voice of Jackie said within the darkness. "There is more Zulu Time."

The voice of Jaime said within the darkness. "Please stay on-line as we clean up the room."

The wall of glass showed an array of wiggling lines of orange, tan, and silver with a jazz song of piano and saxophone of musical notes.

07:30 pm

Glass cage interior setting

Smith Family

Inside the glass cage within the Zulu Time hallway of the Smith family, I gasped with sobs and hiccups of the innocent tiny baby death and watched the wall of glass with wiggling colors inside the next door glass cage, wiping away the sad tears with a whisper of angry for my eardrums only. "The audience judged a three-day old baby guilty of a crime. This is mentally insane. No, I'm getting outta of here. The citizens of Society Four City are mentally crazy sick minded people. I will win my battle inside the Bowl again. Then Dfee and I are leaving Society City Four foreverly and getting happily married. I will not be a part of madness."

Throughout the Zulu Time hallway, the other glass cages slid open by a Regulator. The rest of the people shuffled out from the cage and formed a semi-crooked line over the black carpet. The front of the line stood in front of the closed metal door with the Zulu Time hostess Jamie.

The movement caught my eyesight. I spun around with a gasp to see all the open glass cages. Every single person was shifting around and standing in a crooked line, back slapping with smiles and nods to each other. I was really confused about the people arrangement and quickly counted a tally of thirteen people. However, I saw numerous moms and dads with a collection of children with confusion. All the different families were entering inside the one Zulu Time event. That didn't make any sense to my neurons.

Then I gasped and touched my naked throat. My family and I were the next exhibition inside Zulu Time.

Oltole slowly turned with a gasp and a confused brow to see the line of people also.

Henoana continued to entertain her son Segue inside the wall corner of the glass cage. Genic sat down over the glass floor in the opposite wall corner and played hand games with his daughter Laddie. The parents kept the younger children occupied during Zulu Time.

The wall of glass blinked swiftly blinked from the darkness death into bright illumination of life, showing in the center of the glass a set of two white colored words: Peeker Viewer.

A series of eight side glass door slots silently popped open from the smooth glass wall, revealing an empty hole in the shape of a bloated human body that could fit an upright person. Each slot was a peeker viewer that allowed a person to feel the action, hear the action, and see through the darkness."

Oltole swung around in silence and moved toward one of the peeker viewer with a hum and a smile.

I felt the movement and spun around, reaching out and missed the collar bone of Oltole with a worried brow. "Where are you going, Granny?"

"I want to see the next exhibition of Zulu Time. I recognize the faces of some of these people. I don't understand why this particular group of folks would be here inside Zulu Time. I can't hear the words inside our cage. Genic has shut off both the volume and the picture. I wanna know the reasoning." She entered into one of the glass slots on the light wall of glass and moved forward into a gigantic outline of a human, stopping as her nose bridge tapped onto the glass. She back stepped with a grunt away from the smooth material.

All the peeker viewer slots of glass closed and shut tight.

I covered a mouth with a gasp, staring at the solid black colored wall of glass with a worried brow about my grandmother Oltole.

Genic stood upright with a sour frown and leaned over, touching the electronic volume bar, lowering the volume on the wall of glass again. The glass turned into dark gray, not displaying the violence inside the Zulu Time room.

I turned and gasped at the wall of glass within the empty glass cage. The heated germs of the previous group of people continued to trigger and activate the wall of glass, so I could see the next exhibition of Zulu Time.

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole stood in place with a puzzled brow and shook her gray curls. "What are they doing in here, tonight? I don't understand. This is a very bizarre Zulu Time."

07:31 pm (early evening)

Zulu Time room setting

The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness, "Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!"

A set of two doors opened on each side of the curved wall.

A pale skinned female exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female exited from the other side door as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jaime and Jackie Jones."

Jackie twirled around in a tight circle with a smile to see each tiny black colored glass screen, wearing the same dress, pair of boots, hair style, and colorful facial designs. "I am Jackie. Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice. We will explain the rules for any new audience viewers. When an injustice has occurred, each party is presented here inside the Zulu Time Building."

Jamie swirled around in a tight circle with a smile to see each tiny black colored glass screen also, wearing the same short dress, pair of thigh boots, hair style, and colorful facial designs. "I am Jamie. Then each party is allowed to voice their justification case within a twenty-second time period in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your supper time meal. After twenty seconds has ended, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for the criminal or the letter of V for the victim."

Each female spun around with a smile and moved back to one of two closed doors on the opposite side wall.

The Cee team doorway slid open first.

Jaime pirouetted away from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of thirteen people in front of a low and long bench of soft tan fabric and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and scanned the room with a set of smiles on the other side of the room, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of yellow colors. Each face was decorated with a single finger or a set of fingers from the human hand within one solid colorful tint.

The Vee team doorway slid open next.

Jackie pirouetted around, moving away from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of nine people in front of the same bench stopped. Each person stopped behind her spine and scanned the room with a set of smiles, turning and pointing to each tiny television plasma screen on the curved wall, wearing a formal ankle-length gown or a formal tuxedo of electric blue color. Each cheekbone and a forehead were decorated in a set of colorful smiley face symbols.

Jamie and Jackie spun around met in middle with a smile, twirling in a tight circle with a hand wave to see each glass screen.

Jackie stopped the twirl and raised an arm with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of bright blue. My twin sister Jamie stands behind the Cee team. The Vee team claims that the publishing company which is owned by three families, consisting of thirteen members who are present inside Zulu Time continues to publish a series of numerous unofficial photographs, articles, and novels of the dead actress, whom will not be named here inside Zulu Time. The three owners of the publishing company have been asked numerous times to stop and cease without success. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice their individual justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty-second time period. Since each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jaime raised an arm with a smile and a nod to each glass screen, holding the microphone. "I am Jaime. I stand behind the Cee team which consists of three family units with their biological children. It is important to remember which party you are rooting for within this justification case. You have twenty seconds to state your justification case to the viewers of Society City Four."

Jackie turned with a smile and handed the microphone to the elderly man of the Vee team. Her sister Jamie turned and handed her microphone to the middle aged adult male of the Cee team. They back stepped away from the bench and the two debating teams with a smile, stopping and stood up against a small spot on the curved wall between the rows of tiny black glass screens. Each tiny black screen was six inches long by six inches wide that contained a wall of glass to see and hear the world, especially the world of Society City Four.

The twins stared at the nose profile of each team member, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The first person in the line of thirteen members of the Cee team, a middle aged male wore a yellow colored tuxedo with a pair of golden tinted colored gloves and a matching bowtie. His face showed a single hand digit in rich black color, a "thumbs down" symbol on each cheekbone. The forehead facial design wiggled with life, moving up and down with a crunching sound. He lifted and said with a smile into the microphone. "I do know why I am here. But I am not breaking the law. I am offering a benefit to the nice folks of Society City Four. And you can't stop me, sir. I will continue to offer a benefit to the nice folks of Society City Four."

The first person in the line of nine members of the Vee team, the elderly male wore a blue colored tuxedo with a pair of red tinted hand gloves and a matching bowtie with an orange colored smiley face on each cheekbone. The forehead facial design displayed a smiley face that moved side to side across the wide forehead of the gentleman and giggled with silliness into the eardrums of the team member. The elderly male smiled into the microphone. "You are as tacky as your tuxedo and your pair of glove colors, sir. You are publishing photographs, art work, novels, and articles of my dead wife. She was an actress here within Society City Four. Now, she is gone and dead for two years. Her death is sacred to me. Her visual and audio works are available and displayed on the wall of glass through entertainment programs for all to see. Why can't you leave her body as dead and inside the graveyard?" He sobbed with tears of sadness into the microphone.

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole gasped with a sour frown. "O dear! That elderly man needs more family love and some mental help for his depression."

The third person in the line of thirteen members of the Cee team shuffled and stood in front of the line, reaching out and stole the microphone from the male. He was a middle aged male, wearing a yellow colored tuxedo with a pair of golden tinted colored gloves and a matching bowtie. His face showed a single hand digit in rich black color, a hand gesture with a closed fist on each cheekbone. The forehead facial design shifted up and down, forming a tight fist and then displayed a single middle finger with an evil laugh into the eardrum of the team member. He smiled into the microphone. "Yes, both the audio and visual works of your wife are displayed over a wall of glass into each home. But the nice citizens of Society City Four demand more and more of her. That is a nice gesture that the Society City Four wants to remember your wife."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole smiled with a nod. "Yes, it is a nice gesture to preserve the image of the dead actress through pictures, articles, and novels. I concur."

The second person in the line of nine members of the Vee team shuffled ahead and stood beside his elderly father with the smiley face design, reaching out and stole the microphone, wearing an electric blue colored tuxedo with a pair of red hand gloves and a matching bowtie with a blue colored frown-face on each cheekbone. The forehead facial design shifted the lower lip forth and back, exhibiting the sad pout with a deep sigh into the eardrums of the team member. He said with a sad frown into the microphone. "No, I do not want my mother seen inside new sets of visual photographs, audio articles, and reading novels. My mother died. She is dead and gone from here for two years. I do not want her pictures shown to anyone else. You are selfish and greedy to think that everyone wants that, sir."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole gasped with a sour frown. "I do not think the publishing company is selfish and greedy. They have provided a new set of articles and other materials on the dead actress."

The second person in the line of thirteen members of the Cee team shuffled ahead and stood next to the two middle aged males, a middle aged woman reached over and stole the microphone from her husband with a sneer with a finger jab at the Vee team members, wearing a yellow evening gown with a pair of golden gloves and a single extended index finger on each cheekbone. The single index finger represented the number one symbol. The forehead facial design danced side to side across the forehead with a loud cheer into the eardrums of the team member. "You are selfish and greedy, young man. You should be more kind and understanding. The nice folks of Society City Four do not have your mother anymore for making a new entertainment program. Thus, they still cherish her memory."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole stared and listened to the debate between the Cee and Vee team members, tossing an arm into the air with a smile and a nod. "Yes, she was a wonderful actress. I do still cherish the memory of the dead actress through all the new and old pictures, art works, articles, and novels."

The second person in the line of nine members on the Vee team shuffled ahead and stood next to her husband, the daughter-in-law stole the microphone with a smile, wearing an ankle-length evening gown of electric blue with a pair of matching elbow gloves. Both cheekbones showed a yellow colored crossed-eye face with a sour frown. The forehead facial design moved and shifted with the motion of crossing and uncrossing the pair of eyeballs with a soft giggle into the eardrums of the team member. "Then why don't you get your old wrinkled mother to make a movie for the nice folks of Society City Four?" The members of the Vee team laughed. She frowned. "My nice mother-in-law is dead and is buried down inside the cold hard ground. The dead should stay dead."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole frowned. "Hmm, that is an interesting line. The dead should stay dead. Is that a death threat to the publishing company?"

The second person in the line of thirteen members of the Cee team shuffled ahead and stood next to the two middle aged males and one middle aged woman, she was a middle aged female, reaching over and stole the microphone from the other woman with a sneer with a finger jab at the Vee team members, wearing an evening gown of yellow with a pair of golden elbow gloves. Her cheekbone displayed a multiple colored peace sign with the fingers. The forehead facial design blinked the peace sign of fingers off and on with a soft ting into the eardrums of the team member. "I don't wanna see my wrinkled old mama." The Cee team members laughed. She exhaled. "The nice folks of Society City Four wanna continue to see your beautiful mother. She was a lovely actress who is still being cherished after her death. Long live the memory of your mother-in-law, young woman."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole gasped. "Hmm, the daughter-in-law has a good point. I didn't think about. But I do still cherish the memory of the dead actress through all the new and old pictures, art works, articles, and novels."

The middle aged female, the daughter of the actress mother, who was one of nine members on the Vee team jabbed a finger with a sneer at the Cee team members, wearing an electric blue ankle-length gown with a pair of red short hand gloves with a snotty-nose-like face of neon green on each cheekbone. The forehead facial design moved and shifting a line of neon green snot that fell down the single nostril hole with a soft sneeze into the eardrums of the team member. "Open your clogged eardrums. Open your closed eyelashes. She is dead. But, you are selfish and greedy for coin, nothing more."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole gasped with a sour frown. "Well, that is a hard blow to the publishing company. Yes, it is a true statement. The publishing company receives tons of coin. Maybe, the publishing company should have shared with the family members also."

The middle aged wife of the second middle aged male on the Cee team wore a yellow evening gown with a pair of golden gloves and a single extended index finger on each cheekbone. The single index finger represented the number one symbol. The forehead facial design danced side to side across the forehead with a loud cheer into the eardrums of the team member. She gasped with a sneer at the daughter of the actress mother. "How dare you suggest that to me and my family? We are a legitimate publishing business company. We publish thousands of art works, articles, pictures, and novels for tons of coin."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole nodded with a smile. "Yes, I purchased numerous items through the publishing business company. They do a fine job with their products."

The middle aged female, the daughter of the actress mother, who was one of nine members on the Vee team jabbed a finger with a laugh at the Cee team members. She wore an electric blue ankle-length gown with a pair of red short hand gloves with a snotty-face of neon green on each cheekbone. The forehead facial design moved and shifting a line of neon green snot that fell down the single nostril hole with a soft sneeze into the eardrums of the team member. "Then publish your own ugly mug in a set of colored photographs, art works about your sorry life? However, your ugly face could not sell to any of the perverts on any com-d for one single coin."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole gasped with a sad face. "O dear! That daughter needs more love and some mental help also with her angry issues."

The middle aged wife of the second middle aged male on the Cee team sneered at the daughter of the actress mother. "You should be greatly ashamed of depriving the nice folks of Society City Four of your mother's image. She was a great actress."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole nodded with a smile. "Yes, she was a wonderful actress. She was loved by all. I continue to purchase items through the publishing business company. They do a fine job with their products."

The middle aged female, the daughter of the actress mother, who was one of nine members on the Vee team jabbed a finger with a laugh at the Cee team members. She wore an electric blue ankle-length gown with a pair of red short hand gloves with a snotty-face of neon green on each cheekbone. The forehead facial design moved and shifting a line of neon green snot that fell down the single nostril hole with a soft sneeze into the eardrums of the team member. "You are dense and dumb, ugly and winkled old lady. My mother is dead. You are selfish and greed, desiring to make coin off the pictures, the articles, and the novels of my dead mother. You should be greatly ashamed. I am her daughter. I loved my mother. I have her memory stored inside my active and brilliant mind. You have never met the woman while alive but you will meet her when dead. I promise that."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole gasped with a stern face. "Well, that is another hard blow to the publishing company. Yes, it is a true statement. Coin is made from selling each item of photograph, art work, novel, and article."

The middle aged wife of the second middle aged male on the Cee team sneered at the daughter of the actress mother. "How dare you? We are a legal business entity that sells photographs, articles, novels, and art work."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole gasped with a worried brow. "Yes, it is a true statement. They sell items and make money. Her arguments are not going very well of the viewing audience."

The middle aged female, the daughter of the actress wore an electric blue ankle-length gown with a pair of red short hand gloves with a snotty-face of neon green on each cheekbone. The forehead facial design moved and shifting a line of neon green snot that fell down the single nostril hole with a soft sneeze into the eardrums of the team member. She jabbed a finger with a sneer at each Cee team member. "You and your family, including your precious children are here inside the room of Zulu Time."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole gasped with a worried brow. "Yes, it is a true statement. We are all here inside Zulu Time."

The middle aged wife of the second middle aged male on the Cee team gasped at the daughter of the actress mother. "How dare you threaten my family? What is that statement supposed to mean?"

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole frowned. "We are all here as criminals inside Zulu Time."

The youngest child in the line of nine members of the Vee team shuffled to the front of the line, standing in front of her mother and accepted the microphone, wearing an ankle-length dress of blue with a pair of hand gloves, and a red colored crying-face on each cheekbone. The forehead held a face with a line of red tears, flowing down from one eye socket. She cried with a sad face microphone. "My grandmother is dead. When I see her picture, I cry." She wailed with more tears. The mother reached over and hugged her little daughter.

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole gasped with a sad face. "O dear! That poor child needs more love and some mental help also with her depression issues."

The teen of the Vee team moved and shuffled in the front of the line, standing beside his sister and accepted the microphone from his sister, wearing an electric blue colored tuxedo with a pair of red tinted gloves and a matching bowtie with a set of mouth drool-face on each cheekbone and in the middle of the forehead. The forehead facial design dropped mouth spit on one side of the parted lips with a soft cough into the eardrums of team member. He said with a smile in the microphone. "The number thirteen is an unlucky symbol. You have thirteen members on the Cee team," laughing.

The members of the Cee team gasped in shock and silence.

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole could hear the vile remarks, the nasty sneers, and the shuffle of each shoe sole of the Cee team and gasped in shock. "What a rude teen? He should be punished for that vile statement to a set of adults."

The room went black as the voices faded into silent.

Inside the darken peeker viewer, Oltole could hear the sobs of children, the vile remarks, the nasty sneers, and more shuffling of each shoe sole, covering both eardrums from the loud sounds.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The twenty second deadline has expired."

Inside the darken peeker viewer, Oltole gasped with a sour frown into the darkness to see each figure that shifted side to side. "O dear! I wished that I had a com-d. I would vote for the three families of the publishing company. However, I am confident that there are hundreds of citizens that think as I do."

The voice Jackie said with a smile within the darkness of the Zulu Time room. "You have heard each side of the justification case. Please vote on your com-d as it counts as one vote only."

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness. "If the final number is an exact tie for both the teams, which does happen sometimes, then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl."

The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness of the Zulu Time room also. "The voting is finished. Please illuminate all the glass screens now here inside Zulu Time."

All the tiny glass screens showed a black back ground with one single letter in white.

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Hmm, I am shocked. Are your shocked, Jackie?"

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens also. "Aw, I am shocked, too. Are you really shocked, Jamie?"

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The highest mathematical number wins the justification case. The highest number is the letter V for the victim team."

The tiny glass screens went black. The dark room echoed in a series of loud screams and harsh curses plus the sounds of soft rips and tears of fabric. Then, the room was silent.

A few seconds later, all the overhead lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room again.

On the forward wall, there were thirteen objects that stood in height from tallest down towards shortest. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages from the hair roots down to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

Inside the darken peeker viewer, Oltole gasped with a sour frown. "No, no, no. I can't be. This is a mistake. The viewing audience had selected the three nice families of the publishing company. I was so confident."

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jackie twirled around to see each screen with a smile. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, each Vee team member must participate and accept the judgment. Thus, the Cee team has lost the justification case. Now, each Cee team member has been captured, bandaged, and mounted in the dull color of beige and the pretty color of red against the rear wall for just and justice of the Vee team. Each Cee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment too. Thus, the Cee team is sentenced to death by means of the fun and creative methods of each Vee team member."

Jamie swirled around to see each glass screen with a smile. "Vee team, please select your pleasure. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. Pick out whatever suites your heart and your hand. This part of Zulu Time is the choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Cee team member must fire one weapon at one oval shaped object and kill the wiggling object on the forward wall. A Cee team member will know a kill shot has occurred when the oval shaped object has turned into the color of rich black, covering the tan or red tape. And I do believe that our evening audience of viewers is full of photographs from a dead actress. Maybe, the dead should stay dead."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole huffed with angry. "I can't believe that the citizens voted for the vile family of the dead actress. The dead actress was a nice person. I bet that she is rolling over inside her grave with the nasty conduct from her family members."

The father of the Vee team did not move and stood in the middle of the long bench in front of the seventh medium-sized object of tan and red tape on the forward wall which appeared like a teenager. The other family member scooted around the elderly grandfather and stood in front of one or more oval shaped objects on the wall of criminals.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the sixth member of the Vee team, the father bent down and slipped the soft fabric. The lid lifted upright and displayed an array of deadly weapons. The father reached down and selected an individual weapon, lifting it into the air and passed it to the family member on the right consisting of a long spear, a set of throwing stars, an electric cross bow, a pick axe, a curved sword, and a pair of steak knives. Each family member continued to pass the weapon down to the last person at the end of the line.

The first member of the Vee team, the smallest child held a long spear that was longer than her body, standing in front of the first and tallest object on the wall of criminals.

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole huffed with angry. "A child should not be allowed to come to Zulu Time. That child cannot hold that long spear."

Inside the Zulu Time room, the sixth member of the Vee team, the father continued to lift up and pass along one single weapon to the left side of his family, consisting of a set of nailing hammers, a leather whip with a spiked ball, and a set of daggers. He held the set of daggers with a smirk at the objects on the forward wall of criminals.

The completed taped objects cascading down from the hair roots to the two pinky toes wear a set of red and tan colors wiggled side to side, moaning like a set of haunting ghosts on the forward wall. The families were not hung on the wall of criminals in order of the family unit, such like, father, mother, and child. Instead, the forward wall showed the configuration of the tallest oval shaped object, traveling down to the shortest criminal.

Jackie did not twirl and stared at the wall of criminals with a smile and nod in the same gown and face paint. "There are too many objects on the forward wall. That is not a prob, thou. Each Vee team member is collecting a weapon and standing in front of one or two oval shaped object of tan and red colors. Thus, each Vee team member will hit the object until the red tape turns into the color of black."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole exhaled with a sour frown and an annoyed mind. "Well, I have seen enough. This is done. I want to leave." She swung around and shoved a hand onto the smooth and solid glass door of black tint, whipping the hand back with a gasp and reached down, pushing forward with all her might both hands with a grunt. She screamed and beat on the glass door with panic and both hands. "I want out. Genic, I want out. Genic, let me out!"

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jamie did not swirl and stared with a confused brow at the wall of criminals in the same gown and face paint design. "This is the most confusing row of Vee team members. The smallest child is posed in front of the first and largest object on the wall of criminals. It is obvious that the first and largest object is one of the males from one of the family units. Actually, the first three largest objects represent each male of the three family units. The next three objects represent each wife of the three family units. And next three objects are the teenagers, coming from the three family units. The last four objects are the smaller children."

Jackie stared with a puzzled brow the wall of criminals. "I agree, Jamie. The smallest family members are the children. Each one stands in front of three largest objects, a male on the wall of criminals. The tall teen and the two females, which are the daughters and the daughter-in-law, stands in front of fourth, fifth, and sixth objects on the wall of criminals which is a wife that comes from one of the separate family units. The seventh member of the Vee team, the elderly father stands in front of the seventh which is the tall teenager. The eighth member of the Vee team, the male stands in front of the eighth and ninth objects of red and tan on the forward wall which are the two small children of the Cee team. And last and ninth member of the Vee team, the male stands in front of three smallest objects on the forward wall, the other three child of the Cee team."

Jamie said. "So, a few of the Vee team members has the option of shooting at less two or more oval shaped objects which rest against the forward wall. This justification case cannot be completed until all the objects have turned into rich black on some part of the wrapped body. And the Vee team member will start with the largest object and work down to the smallest object on the forward wall."

The last and ninth member of the Vee team, the son of the elderly father shook a skull and back stepped from the last red and tan oval object on the wall of criminals, turning with a smile and moved ahead, standing next to his father in silence. He leaned down and replaced a set of nailing hammers back down into the low chest, reaching over and jerked up a hand gun near his smile. He turned with a grin and a nod, pointing at the hand gun in silence to his father.

The seventh member of Vee team, the elderly father nodded with a smile in silence and reached down into the low cabinet, replacing the set of sharp daggers down over the soft fabric, accepting a new weapon. He lifted up from the inside the cabinet and passed down a new weapon to each family member of the Vee team with a smile and in silence.

Jackie frowned at the member of the back spines of the Vee team. "Well, folks, this is highly usually but not highly illegal. The Vee team has decided to abandon the individual set of personal weapons and use only a common weapon, a hand gun for each team member. Citizens do not know this. But the long bench has an array of deadly weapons where any person can choose. In the instance, the Vee team has chosen the same weapon, a hand gun. There are plenty of hand guns there to choose, also."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole swung around with a gasp to see a row of hand guns inside the hand of each Vee team member, screaming with pant, spinning around to bang both fists on the door. "Let me out! They have guns. Get me out! It'll be too loud for my ears and my heart. Genic?"

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jamie frowned at the back spine on each Vee team member. "Each Vee team member is returning back the previous weapon as it is stored back down into the low chest by the grandfather and leader of the Vee team. Citizens do not know this unless you have read the Zulu Time rules. Each winning member of the team must not speak or laugh or cough or giggle or dance in show of celebration. Thus, the winning members of the team would be charged as an individual criminal. Then the winning team would find each member on the wall of criminals, too. However, this Vee team has thoroughly read the rules of Zulu Time."

Jackie smiled with a nod. "Each member holds a weapon, now. Each member is ready for action against the wall of the criminals, now. This action requires a row of Regulators, also."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole continued to scream and pound both fists on the solid glass door of black tint with a set of tears, "Out! Guns. Get me out! Genic?"

Inside the Zulu Time room, "I am confused, Jamie." Jackie spun around in the pretty dress with a confused brow and dashed toward the Cee team archway, disappearing in the darkness.

"I am confused more, Jackie." Jaime twirled around in the pretty gown and strolled toward the Cee team archway with a confused brow.

A line of golden tinted Regulators entered the Zulu Time room from the Vee team doorway and then split into two separate groups. One Regulator stopped and stood beside each member of the Vee team passing out a set of earplugs for the loud hand gun noise, clicking off the safety on each gun. Then the team of Regulators turned in unison as one unit and exited through the Cee team member door, disappearing into the darkness.

Jackie and Jaime appeared and stood inside the set of opposite archways on each side of the Zulu Time room for safety with a smile and a nod in unison. "Aim high..."

Both the doors closed.

The ninth and last member of the Vee team, the middle aged male team lifted an arm and pointed at the first member of the Vee team.

The first member of the Vee team, the little girl lifted and aimed a two-fisted hand gun, gritting the teeth, pressing the trigger finger on the weapon. A set of continuous array of bullets released and fired ahead, sailing one at a time through the air waves, hitting numerous tan and red colored tapes that represented the skull, the neck, the heart, and other body parts of the first and large oval shaped object on the forward wall.

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole heard the gun shots with her eardrums and felt the air-punch at the first object on the wall of criminals on her back spine, breathing in shallow air molecules. The peeker viewer used a set of internal air molecules and then forced air balls to simulate each bullet shot on the body of Oltole.

Inside the Zulu Time room, the voice of the male, the first and large object on the wall of criminals briefed screamed with pain, "Argh..." The tan and red colored body of tape jerked up, down, and sideways from an array of bullets. Then, all the red and tan colored taped turned into the hue of rich black on every single part of the dead body.

The first member of the Vee team, the first child dropped down the smoking gun and turned with a grin and nod in silence to see the second member of the Vee team, the second child.

Inside the Zulu Time room, "Waah," the voice of the male, the second and large object on the wall of criminals wailed with a scream. The four limbs of the oval shaped jumped up, down, and sideways, hitting the rear wall. Then, the red and tan colored taped turned black as the body shivered in death.

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole continued to sit on the naked glass floor with screams of pain, leaning a sweaty forehead on the cool glass with sobs and tears of pain with a whisper. "Genic, out..."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole heard the gun shots and felt the air-punch at the fourth object on the wall of criminals on the side of her foot, breathing in shallow air molecules. The peeker viewer used a set of internal air molecules and then forced air balls to simulate each bullet shot on her old an aching elderly body.

Inside the Zulu Time room, "Uoo...," the voice of the female, the fourth object on the wall of criminals screamed out in pain and as, the tan and red colored tape turned rich black hue on the neck and the chest cavity. The object wiggled side to side and moaned like a ghost in death.

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole whimpered in pain and leaned a sweaty forehead against on the cool glass with sobs and tears of pain with a whisper. "Genic, out..."

The fourth member of the Vee team, the teen male dropped down the smoking gun and turned with a grin and a nod in silence to see the fifth member of the Vee team, the adult female.

The fifth member of the Vee team, the adult female lifted and aimed a two-fisted hand gun, gritting the teeth, pressing the trigger finger. A set of continuous array of bullets released and fired, sailing one at a time through the air waves, hitting the red colored tape where the skull was located on the fifth and medium sized oval shaped object on the forward wall.

The voice of the adult female, the fifth object on the wall of criminals screamed in pain and as, the red colored tape into blood black, "Aahh..."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole heard the gun shots and felt the air-punch at the fifth object on the wall of criminals on the side of her back spine, breathing in shallow air molecules. The peeker viewer used a set of internal air molecules and then forced the air balls to simulate each bullet shot on her body in pain.

The seventh member of the Vee team, the elderly father slid to the side and continued the array of bullets, hitting the eighth object on the forward wall on the red colored taped which was the skull of the child.

The seventh member of the Vee team, the elderly father slid down the bench and continued firing an array of bullets, hitting the ninth object on the forward wall on the red colored taped which was the skull of the child.

The ninth object on the wall of criminals, the small child shouted. "Ugh..." The body leaped up and down, bouncing against the back wall. The red colored tape which represented the skull turned into rich black hue of death too.

The noise of each fired bullet was so loud that the loud screams of the three individual children could not be heard.

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole heard the gun shots and felt the air-punch on three separate objects on the wall of criminals on the side of her collar bone. She covered both earlobes and breathed out a set of shallow air molecules. The peeker viewer used a set of internal air molecules and then forced the air balls to simulate each bullet shot on her arching body. Oltole sobbed in pain and leaned a sweaty forehead against on the cool glass with sobs and tears.

The tenth object on the wall of criminals, the small child inside the tan and red colored tape screamed and wiggled side to side over the wall in death of black colors. "Iyhiih..."

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole heard the gun shots, felt the air-punch at the tenth object on the wall of criminals on the side of her collar bone, and covered both earlobes from the loud sound and breathed out a set of shallow air molecules. She leaned a sweaty face and sobbed in pain against on the cool glass with sobs and tears.

The eighth member of the Vee team, the middle aged male dropped down the smoking gun and turned with a grin and nod to see the ninth member of the Vee team, a second male.

The ninth and last member of the Vee team, the second male lifted and aimed a two-fisted hand gun in each cupped hand, gritting the teeth, pressing the trigger finger on each weapon.

Inside the peeker viewer, Oltole continued to hear the loud gun shots and feel the air-punch at the last object on the wall of criminals on the side of her collar bone. Her earlobes were covered. She sweated and breathed out a set of shallow air molecules. The peeker viewer used a set of internal air molecules and then forced the air balls to simulate each bullet shot on her bloody and aching body of an elderly woman. Sh sobbed in pain and leaned a sweaty forehead against on the cool glass with sobs and tears.

The Zulu Time room went black.

The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "It is done."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "I hoped that you have enjoyed the evening program, so far."

The voice of Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "The afternoon is still young and fresh. Sit back and stay tuned for more Zulu Time."

The wall of glass inside every home within Society City Four changed into a set of wiggling lines of orange and red colors with a musical song of loud drums and guitars of a country music.

Inside the glass cage of the Smith family, each peeker viewer door slid opened in silence.

The heart of Oltole did not stop pumping out vital blood, but her mind was dizzy with pain. Both eardrums rang with gunshot echoes inside the enclosed peeker viewer. She screamed with fear and fell forward, landing onto the glass floor of the glass cage with a set of heavy breathes and a pair of bloody fists.

I stood in front of the entrance glass door with a scream of fright and worry and pointed down at my grandmother over the glass floor.

Genic stood upright and dashed away from Laddie, sliding down over the floor, leaning over his mother with a worried brow and a worried heart, reaching over and lifted Oltole up from the floor, standing with her. Henoana stood upright with a gasp and dashed toward Genic and Oltole, stopping and stood on the other side of Oltole, reaching out and held the other arm of the elderly lady with a worried brow.

The glass entrance door slide open inside the Smith family. The Regulator stood outside on top of the black carpet and droned without a smile or an emotion to see Genic, Henoana, and Oltole. "It is Zulu Time."

I reached down and gathered the long skirt, turning to the side of smooth glass wall, allowing my parents and my grandmother to leave the glass cage first.

Genic, Oltole, and Henoana moved through the opening in a sideways pose one at a time, since Oltole was sobbing with tears of dizziness and pain. Oltole stood in the middle of the hallway. Genic emerged and cuddled his mother. Henoana exited the room and cuddled the other side of her mom-in-law.

They slowly turned and slowly moving head toward the closed metal door that led into the Zulu Time room and stopped in front of the cold metal. Genic and Henoana whispered and patted on both arms of Oltole with worry.

I spun around with the gathered skirt and reached out, extending a free hand to my sister Laddie.

Laddie grabbed the hand and sobbed with tears for her grandmother, running ahead of her sister Igala, releasing the hand with Igala. She dashed through the open archway and turned, plowing into the rear evening gown of her mother.

Segue moved ahead of Igala through the archway and turned, dashing into the rear dress of his mother Henoana, also.

Henoana released the arm of Oltole and spun around, squatting down with a set of whispers and kisses into the face of each worried child.

I strolled ahead through the archway, alone, swiftly turning and abruptly stopped behind the back spines of my family members.

Genic, Oltole, Henoana, Segue, and Laddie stood upright and huddled together in the color of dull pink that didn't shine down from the artificial lights on the ceiling, posing in front of the closed metal door.

08:01 pm (mid-evening)

Zulu Time room setting

Hot temperatures and bright sunlight

Smith family (criminals) versus Lexedo family (victims)

The single Regulator standing against the glass wall of another cage for drama or security didn't speak but elegantly pointed an index finger down at the black carpet which was behind the back spine on the Zulu Time hostess Jaime where each criminal family member was supposed to stand.

The archway into the criminal side wall of the Zulu Time room was closed, tossing the entire hallway into darkness.

The criminal hostess named Jaime chanted in unison with her sister Jackie on the Vee side of the hallway inside a hand-held microphone with a whisper, since the microphone would re-broadcast her voice into a black tinted wall of glass inside each home within Society City Four. Jaime stood behind a closed metal door inside the darkness of the Cee criminal hallway. Her dress didn't spark in the black color. She whispered, "Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!"

Then each face of both girls appeared together on each wall of glass in every home within Society City Four. A new song of trumpets and piano jazzy musical notes and an array of colorful lavender and maroon fireworks flamed over the collar bones of both recorded photographs of Jackie and Jaime within the blazing colorful background.

The Zulu Time room was fashioned into a backward D-shape into one continuous curvy wall and a long and straight forward wall of tan fabric. The curved wall was colored in tan without an art painting or a viewing window of the trees and the sunlight, holding millions of tiny six inches by six inches dark black tinted glass screens. The forward wall was long and straight, holding emptiness.

Inside the Cee team hallway, the metal door was closed. I stood behind an ugly lump of curved back spines that made up the rest of my family members with a sour frown. I was too annoyed and too miffed with my grandmother Oltole to be worried about the stupid rules, the silly requirements, and the legal regulations of Zulu Time at the moment.

Her family members were huddled and cuddled together behind the back spine on Jaime between a row of Regulators, producing a set of ghostly moans and soft groans for their injured grandmother and their individual selfish reasons.

I crossed both arms over the dress with a sour frown at my family without a face of tears and fears and sobs. I didn't felt faint, only mad at my grandmother.

Oltole had purposely entered the peeker viewer inside the wall of glass inside the assigned glass cage, knowing full well the terrible and horrible visual, mental, and vocal consequences like Segue had experienced twice. Now, she was cuddled and patted on each body part like a whining and peeing puppy dog on top of the wet floor.

The criminal side door slid open along with the victim side door at the same time on curvy wall.

I didn't bother to shade my sensitive eyelashes from the bright lights inside the Zulu Time room, exhaling with a puff of annoyance. The twin sister Jackie inside her open archway signaled in silence a smile and a nod to her sister Jaime.

Jackie was a pale skinned female, exiting from her archway. Jamie was a dark skinned female, exiting from the criminal archway as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison. "Good evening from Jackie and Jaime Jones."

Jackie slowly twirled in a tight circle in the same pretty gown and facial designs with a smile to see each black tinted glass screen. "I am Jackie. Zulu Time is a specific place and time for you to be the judge, the jury, and the executioner of justice. We will explain the rules for any new audience attendees. When an injustice has occurred, each party is presented here inside the Zulu Time building."

Jamie slowly twirled in a tight circle in the same pretty gown and facial designs with a smile at each glass screen. "I am Jamie. Then each party is allowed to voice their justification case within the twenty seconds time period in front of you and your glass wall while you rest and eat your supper time meal. After the twenty seconds ends, you will judge the winner with the letter of C for criminal or the letter of V for victim."

The criminal door closed with a soft thud.

I didn't bat an eyelash but a soft growl of annoyance.

The rest of Smith family continued to huddle and cuddle into an ugly ball of green tinted bodies in front of the closed metal door.

Inside the Zulu Time, room, each female spun around with a smile and moved back to a closed door.

The criminal door slid open for a third time.

Jamie approached with a smile and a nod to see the black colored hair roots of Genic, who stood tallest and upright among the Smithy bubble of heated bodies and then spun away from Genic with the same frozen smile, leading the huddle of Genic, Oltole, Henoana, Segue, and Laddie over the hard surface into the Zulu Time room. The two children continued to bury a face with a set of giggles into the rear gown of their mom Henoana for fun and hug her legs with the fun game.

The blob of emerald green colored Smith family stopped and stood in front of a low long bench of soft beige fabric without scanning the interior of the familiar room. Three of the walls were curved and displays millions of tiny six inches by six inches black tinted glass screens that represented a registered com-d within Society City Four.

I moved ahead alone with a set of crossed arms and a soft sneer and stopped with a snort of bad manners without viewing the same old Zulu Time room which I knew from my bad memories, twice.

The entire floor was a tan colored semi-hard surface with a wall-to-wall long sitting bench which was covered in beige fabric. The bench rested one-fourth into the depth of the room. The forward wall was composed of a cloth-like substance of tan colored with a series of thick horizontal tapes that held each upright body of the unlucky loser within Zulu Time.

Jackie turned with a smile, leading a line of six people in front of the same bench and stopped. Each person stopped and finger pointed in the banquet room with a smile wearing formal attire in the color of rich black with a set of round-shaped symbols in the color of aquamarine, representing a single tire on an ancient car that belonged to Igala, the criminal of the crime.

Jamie and Jackie spun around met in middle with a smile, twirling in a series of graceful tiny circles without dizziness and with a hand wave to see each glass screen too.

Jackie stopped the whirl and lifted an arm into the air with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone like a thick black colored stick. "I am Jackie. I stand behind the Vee team in the color of rich black. My twin sister Jamie stands behind the Cee team. The Vee team claims that their daughter was involved and injured in a careless automobile wreck at the local school Hall. Now, their daughter can't concentrate on her Hall studies. She is falling behind all the academics studies and might not be able to get a re-gen job to sustain her needs of food, water, shelter, and upcoming babies. The family demands just and justice. This is the justification crime. The citizens of Society City Four will serve up true justice for each team."
Jamie stopped the twirl and lifted an arm in the air with a smile and a nod, speaking into an old fashioned microphone. "I am Jamie. I stand behind the Cee team in the color of dull pink. Each team will have twenty seconds to voice the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Each team member is allowed to speak on the crime until the end of the twenty seconds which is a timed deadline. Since, each team member will be held accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jackie turned with a smile and handed the microphone to Kallidin, who stood in the first position of the column of the Vee team members. Her sister Jamie turned and handed the microphone to the Genic, who stood outside the huddle of curved bodies of the Cee team members that continued to cuddle with giggles and moans. Then each hostess back stepped from the bench and the two debating teams, stopping and stood inside an empty spot on the rear wall, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

Kallidin was a tall and slender teen girl with a head of long red colored hair and a tone of bronze skin, wearing a short party dress of rich black with a single aquamarine colored circular old fashioned automobile tire on each cheekbone. She held a microphone with a set of manicured fake fingernails in the color of blood red hues with a confused brow at the ugly huddle of the Smith family. She could not see her schooler friend Igala who stood somewhere behind the blob of rounded dull pink satin clothing. She giggled with a smirk into the microphone first. "I call Tag Team. Tag Team. I proclaim Tag Team. I don't wanna waste the time. Tag Team..."

I couldn't see my girl pal and schooler mate Kallidin through the blob of dull pink colors of curved bodies and gasped with alert, after hearing the familiar words from the lips of Kallidin. I stepped ahead and stood beside my father Genic, leaning over and jerked the microphone from the loose gloved hand of Genic, slamming it into my parted lips with a shout and a stern face. "I call Tag Team, too. Tag Team. Tag Team..."

Jackie lifted both arms and the microphone into the air with a stern face and a serious tone, facing Kallidin without twirling around in a circle to see each glass screen. "Stop, now. Silence, now."

Jamie lifted both arms and the microphone into the air with a stern face and a serious tone, facing Igala without twirling around in a circle to see each glass screen. "The Tag Team has been called by two of the Zulu Time team members."

Jackie turned with a stern face and jabbed a finger with a nod to Kallidin. "Who are the members of your Tag Tean?"

Kallidin spun around with a grin and a giggle to face the closed archway of the Vee team.

The Vee team door slid opened.

A line of five tall teenage males jogged forward into the Zulu Time room, coming from the darkness of the hallway and stopped, standing in a semi-straight row with a smile and a grunt next to Kallidin. The rest of her family members silently stood behind the back spine on Kallidin. Kallidin turned with a smirk and marched down the row of cute teen hunky males with a smile on her re-designer foundation, jabbing a fake re-designer blood red colored fingernail at each chest of muscle with a giggle into the microphone. "Cousin Slim, Cousin Sleek, Cousin Slick, Cousin Dirk, Cousin Jim, and me." She turned and stood last in the line of cute teen hunky males with a giggle and a grin, seeing Igala on the other side of the room.

I dropped open a mouth in silence at the row of five cute teen hunky males. Ucal had told Igala to say out loud the word Tag Team inside the Zulu Time room during the justification case, but he had not explained the reason. I couldn't fathom a reason or an answer, until now.

Now, Ucal and I were going to fight against a wall of five times muscle, strength, and tallness.

Jackie raised both her arms and the microphone into the air with a stern face and a serious tone. "Stop, now. Silence, now."

Jamie turned with a smile and a nod to see Igala and the ugly huddle of her family members. "Who is on your Tag Team?"

I slowly turned with a puff of worry to face the closed metal door of the Cee team entrance hallway. The door slid open on the side of the wall for the Cee team entrance.

"Us!" Ucal ran out from the open archway of the Cee team with a shout and a smile, jogging toward Igala with a nod.

Dfee followed behind the back spine on his buddy Ucal with a smile and turned with a hand wave to see each glass screen. He stopped and stood in place, swirling in a circle like the twin hostesses on the edge of the boot heels with a chuckle and stopped in place again. He shifted and danced side to side with a chuckle, clapping both hands with a smile, rotating the neck muscles side to side, humming a country side. There was not any music inside the Zulu Time room, only a set of upcoming gun fire deadly shots.

Ucal stopped with a sneer and spun around, reaching out and grabbed the collar bone of Dfee with a snarl, pulling his friend over the hard surface toward Igala into the sneer and a whisper. "This is not a dance show. It is death show."

Dfee moved with his friend smiled into the nose bridge of Ucal. "I'll making new friends. It's always nice to play well inside the sandy sandbox, bro."

Ucal dragged Dfee toward the blob of bodies with a sneer and a sour frown. "Get into the line, boy." Ucal stopped and stood next to Igala with a smile and a nod to the Zulu Time hostesses in silence.

Dfee stopped and stood beside Ucal, turning with a smile and a wink to see Igala.

I winked at Dfee and then swung around with a smile and a nod to see Jamie. "Me and them, I plan to play and stay with my Tag Team, too."

Jaime pointed at Igala with a stern face and a nod. "The Tag Team call is actually a person substitution mechanism within the Zulu Time rules."

Jackie pointed at Kallidin with a stern face and a nod. "The family unit can substitute another person to fight for them inside the Zulu Time."

Jackie and Jaime said in unison with a smile and a nod. "Except, one original team stays..."

"The Tag Team..." Jaime twirled around in the pretty dress with a smile at each glass screen.

"The Tag Team..." Jackie swirled in the opposite direction beside her sister in the pretty dress with a smile to see each glass screen also.

My eyelashes darted back to the set of swirling twins, the wall of glass screens, and finally back to Kallidin. She shrugged with a silly smirk in silence at Igala. My eyelashes turned to see the blob of pink colored bodies with a gasp of shock.

Genic leaned over with a smile and a whisper into the bruised face of his mother, patting her arm with care, ignoring his oldest daughter who was going into battle again for the second time.

Jackie and Jaime both stopped the twirl with a smile and a nod to some of the glass screens. "Zulu Time has ended."

The lights went black.

A group of Regulators entered through each archway, reaching and dragging off the non-fighting family members of each Cee and Vee teams off the floor of Zulu Time and back through the archway, herding them into a huddle, moving through the archway.

"Good luck, Igala. But you don't need it." Genic said with a smile into the face of his mother, patting her hand with care.

Henoana said with a smile and cuddled her two other children, moving toward the open archway. "We must leave Zulu Time. But you know that. We will be watching on the glass screen inside the limousine, going back home. But, you know that, too."

The huddle of bodies slowly entered the Cee team hallway, leaving the Zulu Time room, disappearing into the darkness.

I spun around with a fake smile to see the back spines of the blob of bodies.

The Cee team door slid closed.

Each member of the Smith family had left the Zulu Time room without planting a wet kiss on the cheekbone of Igala or a handshake of luck to Dfee and Ucal. Then the rest of the Smith family will leave the Zulu Time building and will ride back inside a smooth airship limousine with a set of smiles and laugher, heading back to the house while watching the Zulu Time action on the small black tinted glass screen inside the leather seat like the previous three times.

All the overhead lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room, again.

I whispered with a worried heart for my eardrums only to the closed door. "Yeah, leave and go back home, Mom, Dad, Laddie, Segue, and Granny. I'm okay here within Zulu Time. I think not..." I exhaled with a puff of worry and annoyance at my parents and my foes, seeing the rear blonde-strawberry colored hairy skull of Ucal.

Ucal had swung around with a smile and then a sour frown, pointing over the collar bone of Dfee with a grunt. "Where in the world are the rest of our team mates for the Bowl battle in a few seconds, boy?"

Dfee spun around with a smile to stare at an empty line of non-bodies, seeing all the black tinted glass screens, swinging back around with a chuckle and a wink to see Igala. "I thought you were getting the rest of the criminal team mates, bro."

He sneered. "Where in the universe are the rest of our deadly weapons, Dfee?"

Dfee lifted up and held his personal switchblade near a smirk. "I thought you were getting the rest of the weapons, bro."

"Dfee?" Ucal snarled.

Dfee chuckled with a wink at Igala. "Dfun, Dfit, Dwit, Dfee, that's me."

"Ugh, we need a set of weapons before we die inside the Bowl." Ucal growled.

Dfee winked with a grin to Igala, again. "I got it covered..."

"You got it, not covered." Ucal spun around with a fake smile and cuddled Igala with a soft sneer, seeing the row of new teens that equaled both the heights and the weights of him and Dfee. The tall teen males could beat the snot outta of Igala. So Ucal would be protecting her again inside the Bowl arena.

Jackie smiled with a nod to see each glass screen. "The Tag Team has activated the Bowl rules."

"The Bowl..." Jackie twirled around in a tight circle with a smile to see each glass screen.

"The Bowl..." Jaime swirled in the opposite direction beside her sister with a smile to see each glass screen also.

My eyelashes darted to the swirling twins again, the wall of glass screens, and back to see Ucal. He shrugged with a silly smirk in silence. My eyelashes turned and looked at Kallidin. She was staring with a grin and a giggle at the swirling twins, elbowing the cute teen male by her side.

Jaime stopped the twirl and pointed to Igala with a smile and a nod. "The Bowl has been called."

Jackie stopped the swirl and pointed to Kallidin with a smile and a nod. "The Bowl will first occur when the justification case tally is an exact mathematical tie for both the parties, which does happen occasionally, and then both the teams must participate inside the Bowl."

Jaime nodded with a smile to Igala. "There is a second occurrence of the Bowl when a member of either team calls the word, Tag or Tag Team. Therefore, the justification case has been expanded into a cat fight between the new Cee team and the new Vee team, thus the fight will occur inside a selected Bowl environment until one team or one person lives without or with bloody injuries. Now, each team will leave the floor of Zulu Time for the cat fight inside the Bowl, right now."

Both side doors slid open.

Jackie and Jaime whirled in the opposite direction and waved a hand with a smile to see each glass screen, saying in unison, entering into the appropriate door. "See ya'll in a few..."

The overhead lights went black.

Ucal spun around with a huff toward the open archway of the Cee team with a sneer alone. "We need to move toward the Bowl arena, now."

Dfee leaned over and grabbed the hand of Igala with a grin and a chuckle, tucking her into the side of his aqua colored sporting jacket, leading them behind the behind spine of Ucal toward the open archway with a smile.

I frowned with worry inside the warm arms of Dfee. "We gotta leave for the Bowl arena, now. Why?"

At 08:10 pm, Ucal led through the open archway of the Cee hallway and turned to the side, dashing back over black colored carpet over the Zulu Time hallway and down the rows of empty glass cages. Igala was the last Zulu Time candidate for the evening.

I dashed ahead and held the hemline on my dull pink and dirty evening dress with a worried brow, dragging Dfee by the hand and behind me, pulling up beside Ucal. "So, how does this Tag Team rule work for my safety, again?"

Ucal moved forward down the black carpet of dried blood stains of past dead bodies with a sigh and a worried brow. "You can substitute one person for all your family members, but one. Or you can substitute one family member, keeping the rest, as long as, one original family member stays and dies during the Tag Team, coming from the original Cee or Vee team."

I nodded with a sneer. "Kallidin came into Zulu Time with all her family members and then called Tag Team. Then she substituted the rest of her entire family members and brought in her five cousins."

Dfee pulled up beside Igala and leaned over her chest to see the nose profile of Ucal "Geez! These five tall and ugly teen males are not her biological blood-cousins. They are ugly and big and ugly and big," he stood upright with a grin and a laugh, cuddling into Igala with a smile.

Ucal exited through the Zulu Time hallway and marched down the wooden hallway of the courthouse toward the Cee Building marble floor with a sour frown. "It was a trick play or a loophole within the Zulu Time rules. A person rarely calls out the Tag, so it has not been fixed."

I gasped. "Fixed?"

Dfee laughed. "Fix my supper. Fix my tire. Fix my brain. Fix my heart. Fix my death. Geez, I'm going to die, this round."

Ucal leaned over the breasts of Igala with a sneer to see the smile on Dfee. "You haven't even played inside the Bowl, yet, Dfee."

Dfee moved ahead with his friend with a smile and a laugh. "Well then, I will die inside the Bowl, this round."

08:13 pm (late evening)

Cee Building location

Wooden hallway setting

Ucal continued to lead the row of teens and moved pass the hallway of the Cee suites in silence.

I skidded both spiked heels over the wooden floor to stop with a gasp. Dfee caught and shoved Igala forward over the wooden floor with a grin and a chuckle, wrapping both arms around her waist. I pointed to the side at the white marble hallway with a worried brow and a sissy whine. "That's, there's the wing of Cee suites over there. And it is behind us. My clothes of blue jeans and boots are living in there. We need the T-shirts that absorb the red blood of Kallidin. I need to remove my dress now..."

"I like the way that Igala talks and thinks." Dfee laughed, "Smearing the blood of Kallidin over her breasts! Can I touch and join your fun of smeared beasts, too, beauty, please?"

Ucal growled. "We don't have time to stop and change clothes. We don't need to wear the red shirts to smear blood over our naked and angry faces."

I frowned. "I don't want to wear anyone's red blood proteins. Yes, we have plenty of time. Yes, I need to change into a pair of jeans and my boots. I am wearing a third foot evening gown and a pair of spiked heels. Are you freaking blinded, Ucal?"

Ucal continued to march over the wooden hallway, leaving the Cee chamber hallway and turned the corner where the morgue held all the dead bodies of the Cee team members that were prepared for an upcoming family unit tomb burial. "We don't have time. The rules of the Tag Team are different from the rules of the Tag. The Tag allows time for the biological family or the other team members of the Tag to rest, to eat, and to dress. The Tag Team rule does not."

I turned the corner with Dfee and Ucal and rushed down the wooden hallway toward the Zulu Time arena with a sour frown. "Who says?"

"Zulu Time rules." Ucal exhaled and continued marching toward the Zulu Time arena.

"Why not? I don't understand." I marched in the row with Dfee and Ucal with a sour frown.

Ucal continued to move ahead down the semi-dark wooden hallway and shook a skull with a sour frown. "You never read the rules, Igala."

I shook my curls, since both my hands were holding up the dress hem before I tripped and blooded my nose. "Okay, I don't read the rules of Zulu Time. What is the rule of the Tag Team?"

Ucal exhaled. "The Tag Team is rarely ever called out during Zulu Time. All the newly assigned team members must report to the Bowl arena like immediately, right now."

I moved ahead with them with a gasp. "Who says? Why is that? I need to change my dress. I can't fight in a dress with a three-foot train..."

"There is not any time given to the newly assigned team members to formulate a plan or gather more weapons or change the clothing."

I exhaled. "Wait! Then, why did you have me call out Tag Team. I could have used the Tag concept. Then, I could have changed my clothes and mentally prepared for the upcoming fight inside the Bowl like I did the last time. Do you remember, Ucal?"

Ucal exhaled. "You did and you used it. It is gone. There is not a second Tag concept available within Zulu Time. The Tag concept is used and abuse, one time. Usually, the family is dead. Usually, the other family is alive. And the live family never ever comes back into Zulu Time. You had to use the Tag Team concept, this round inside Zulu Time to survive, again."

I exhaled. "Geez, now, I know."

"Now, you know to read the rules of Zulu Time."

I growled. "I don't need a childish lecture."

He growled. "I don't need a silly response."

Dfee clapped a hand over his jeans with a smile. "Okay, children, we stay and play nicely together," he leaned over with a smile and whisper into her cheekbone. "See? He is not your type of marrying sweet husband. He argues too much and is a meanie..."

"I heard that, Dfit." Ucal growled.

Dfee leaned over the front of Igala with a sour frown to see the nose profile of Ucal. "Really? You heard my whisper into the cheekbone of Igala. Then, repeat it all to my eardrums, boy?"

I lifted and shoved one hand into the cheekbone of Dfee from my footpath with a sneer. He stumbled ahead and spun around, running backwards with a grin and a wink at Igala. I moved forward and turned down the next passage way toward the entrance of the Zulu Time with a sour frown. "Stop it, both of you. What is the strategy to win the Bowl, today, like right now in a few seconds?" I halted at the open archway with a worried brow and a worried heart.

In front of the side wall, a row of sparking golden tinted Regulators stood in silence and brilliance underneath the artificial lamps, staring at the opposite wall, a pair of steel and rusty doors which was the entrance into the Zulu Time arena for the Bowl.

At 08:15 pm, a pair of rusty steel doors slowed parted with a sound of tiny squeaks and emitted a patch of bright sunshine and heated temperatures through the cracks of space.

"Hmm! That door really needs some oil to fix these annoying squealing piggy sounds." Dfee laughed with a smile. "I think that I should run back into the Cee suites and find some."

Ucal held the hand of Igala with a stern face and moved ahead through the parted doors and stopped, standing near the edge of the Cee platform, staring at the Bowl arena inside the Zulu Time event. The wooden platform shook side to side with a loud rumbling noise.

"Hey!" Dfee scooted ahead and pulled up beside Igala, reaching down, grabbing the other hand of Igala with a smile, looking up with a grin into the bright colors before the sunset, shading both eyeballs with the free hand. "It looks like rain."

The arena was built into a T-shape, sideways. There were two parallel flat wooden platforms that faced each other. One elevated platform surface held the Cee team members, consisting of Igala, Dfee, and Ucal as each one whispered into each other's face inside a tight huddle.

The opposite elevated wooden platform of planks held a non-family unit of six individuals that made up the Vee team. Each member stood apart and scanned the guts of the dirt ground in silence.

Between the two elevated platforms, there was flat ground soil of red dirt, so the spilled human blood didn't show.

There was a solid concrete wall that connected both platforms with a drawing. The drawing showed a set of four rings high in the air as a set of four individual horses leaped into the air and jumped through each hoop with a single rider.

On the opposite wall of the two platforms, there was a much longer wall of solid green colored painting that showed a set of six elevated circular rings in the air and a set of six horses with a rider. Each horse leaped through a ring into the air.

In front of the longer wall, there were a set of four circular rings that were attached on top of an individual short pole. The pole stood upright in the soil at two feet. On top of the pole, there was a single ring that was hollow for jumping through which was similar to the drawing on the painted wall between the twin platforms.

Beside the row of four rings, there was a second row of a set of four individual two feet high free-standing fence posts that were designed with a set of pretty colorful garden flowers with matching greenery vines which was staggered between each ring like a playground park for fun.

I looked up and searched the white clouds and a blue sky with a confused brow. "Naw! There isn't a rain cloud up there within my eyeballs."

Dfee nodded with a smile. "I hear the rumble of a thunderstorm. This is really good."

"Why, Dfee?" I turned and smiled at the nose profile of Dfee.

Dfee nodded with a smile at the sky and turned to see the nose profile of Ucal. "I play 'bestest' inside a rain storm. Do you remember? As a young kid, I beat the snot outta you, Ucal, during that violent rainstorm inside the back yard of your house. Yeah, the rain, lightning, and thunder all make me really angry and mad and lucky for me, too." He reached up and slapped his chest with a nod and a chuckle.

Ucal shifted side to side, looking across with a confused brow at the Cee platform surface, feeling the rumble. "Shut it, Dfee! What is that loud noise? Why is the platform top shaking underneath my boot toes? I thought the platforms were made of solid concrete. This one is made of wood from a tree bark." He continued to hold her hand and shuffled side to side in confusion.

I leaned with a smile and a whisper into the cheekbone of Ucal. "Ucal, do you see what I see?"

"Yes." Ucal smiled and stared at the same thing across the way.

Dfee leaned over with a smile and a hum into the cheekbone of Igala. "Do you see what I see? Do you see what I see? That's a happy holiday song. I like. Kinda like your name, I gala. I gay. I glad ya'll cane...came...come. I glad you is here. Do you see? I forced it to rhyme on a dime," chuckling with silly boyfriend love.

"Shut up, Dfee." Ucal stared with a sour frown and a sneer at each Vee team member.

"Just helping," Dfee looked down with a confused brow to see the dirt and the row of standing rings with confusion.

"Just harming," Ucal stared at each neighing horses.

He turned and scanned the dirt and the objects. "I don't get the setup of the Bowl field for playing or dying." Dfee leaned over with a smile into her cheekbone. "What environment did you pick, honey?"

I looked ahead and stared with a smile at the opposite platform with the Vee team, "Horses."

Dfee turned and stared at a row of horses that was housed underneath the wooden platform on top of the Vee team platform which was across from the Cee team platform with a smile. "O. I see a set of one, two, three..."

"Six horses for six evil enemies, our enemies are standing across the way inside an individual barn stall." Ucal smiled. "So we have three horses underneath our boot heels for each one of us, making lots of noise, too. So that's why the platform is shaking."

Dfee continued to frown at each barn stall underneath the Cee platform. "Are the horses really real?"

Ucal exhaled. "Yes, they are real like the sharks that were real and really inside the pool of salt water inside the first Bowl that Igala and I fought and won."

Dfee smiled. "But horses are nice and kind. They're our friends."

I exhaled. "Horses are mean and bite when approached with a nasty temper. You could get kicked in the head and dead too."

Ucal frowned at the Vee platform, the horses, and the Vee team members. "What's our strategy here, teens?"

Dfee frowned at the barn stalls. "Why did you pick the Bowl environment of horses?"

I smiled at my schooler friend on top of the Vee platform. "Kallidin rides horses and loves horses."

Dfee gasped at the horses. "I still don't comprehend the horsey and dirty environment. That means she is an excellent horse rider on top of a galloping horse. And the Bowl environment is horsey and dirty with dirt for riding on top of a horse."

I stared with a smirk at Kallidin on top of the Vee platform even with my eyeballs. "Yeah..."

"And that works to her advantage, but not mine. I'm not an excellent horse rider." Ucal frowned at the horses.

I smiled with an evil laugh at Kallidin. "But, I am."

Dfee turned and smiled at the cheekbone of his girl. "Igala's smart."

"Igala's pretty." Ucal turned and smiled at the other cheekbone of his girl.

"Igala's my girl." Dfee shuffled closer and hugged Igala with a grin.

"Igala's my girl." Ucal moved closer and hugged Igala, turning with a sneer to see Dfee.

I shoved both teen males from my body and stared with a snarl at Kallidin. "Stop it, boys! We need to win the Bowl battle here and now."

Dfee leaned over and smiled into her cheekbone. "Then will you pick one of us, boys to spend the rest of our day with your long life and happiness? Like me?"

I exhaled with a puff of hope and stared with a stern face at Kallidin, who danced on top of the Vee platform. "Yes, I promise I will pick a boy for my husband. But we need a strategy to win the Bowl competition, before we all die and ascend somewhere. Does anyone have any suggestions? Since none of us has a weapon to live through the fight."

Dfee stood upright and waved both arms, dancing side to side over the Cee platform with happiness.

Ucal stood upright and stared with a worried brow at the horses that reared and kicked at the front door of each stall underneath the Vee platform.

Dfee stopped the dance and leaned over with a smile into the cheekbone of Igala, lifting and held the object near his grin. "I have changed my mind about the Regulators. They are really stupid. Since they didn't search each criminal, but they should have like me."

Ucal turned and frowned at the object near the grin of Dfee. "Hot dang it, boy! You are holding a box of real flaming matches. What are you doing with a box of matches, Dfee?"

I turned and smiled at Dfee in silence

Dfee turned and winked at Igala. "I was giving myself a grand birthday party, without you, Ucal. It was my birthday, yesterday."

Ucal reached over behind the back spine on Igala with a smile and slapped the back spine on Dfee with a nod. "Congrats, bro! I'll kiss your button hole later, after I kill Kallidin in her blood here inside the Bowl."

Dfee leaned over a whisper and a smile into her cheekbone. "You're so smart, beauty. You remembered the burning candles inside the underground cavern inside Society City Five that we shared that day."

I stood upright with a grin and stared with a sneer at Kallidin. "Yeah, and I remembered that the grandmother of Kallidin has a corral of horses. But I didn't know what particular breed. With only one hour to prep the Bowl arena, the Regulators must use some of the resources from the Vee team." I turned and frowned at the nose profile of Ucal. "Do you know, Ucal?"

Ucal shook his strawberry blonde colored cropped skull with a sour frown. "I really don't give a dang, now."

"I only got two matches inside my match box." Dfee shook the box of matches with a smile. "So we set each horse's tail on fire."

I frowned. "No, you will not harm those beasties. We set Kallidin's long red hair strands on blazing fire," giggling.

Ucal smiled. "I like."

Dfee frowned. "You're evil, girl."

I giggled. "Six rounds of Zulu Time makes a girl vicious."

Ucal frowned. "This is only your third Zulu Time."

I smiled. "The number three isn't evil. The number six is."

Dfee chuckled. "Sixth, not time, is the charmer." He shook his curls. "That's doesn't rhyme."

"Shut it, Dfee." Ucal sneered.

"What's the battle plan, Ucal?" I turned and scouted the Bowl arena with a stern face. "Let's see if I got this right. The parking lot is south of us which is a no-go. The Vee building is east of us, which is a no-go, also. We came from the Cee building which is in the direction of west." I turned and viewed the northern direction which showed a solid wall between the two elevated platforms of wooden planks with a smile and a nod. "So, we go north."

Dfee leaned over into her cheekbone with a puzzled brow. "That's a great plan for escaping, Igala. What about the plan for fighting, beauty?"

I turned with a sigh to see the row of healthy teens on top of the Vee platform. "I ain't fighting against five ugly males with bad breath."

Ucal chuckled. "Dfee will."

"What the fudge?" Dfee turned and sneered at Ucal.

Ucal leaned over the front of Igala and shoved the chest of Dfee with a sneer. "Dfee, go and create a diversion for us. While we wait..."

Dfee leaned over with a smile into her cheekbone. "What kind of diversion for my sweet Igala? Because, I don't give a pea stain about your blue jeans, Ucal," laughing.

Ucal chuckled. "And you only get two matches. So, be wise and try to be smart."

"Smart hole, I'm only need one match to start a forest fire." Dfee buzzed the lips with a sour frown.

Ucal laughed. "So, go and start a fire..."

"A fire?" Dfee exhaled. "Uh, there is very limited breathing air space inside the physical place of a park. The walls are solid concrete, Ucal. We all could die of smoke inhalation, first and then actually burn up, second."

Ucal released the hand of Igala, leaning over and shoved Dfee from Igala with a sneer. "Go now and start the fire!"

Dfee sneered. "Dang, you go and start the fire!"

Ucal growled. "You possess the box of two unused matches."

He frowned. "O yeah. So, I'm off to start a fire. I hope that I don't die, because my dead and glowing he-ghost will haunt your private bedroom scene, since I know where you sleep, man." Dfee laughed.

"I'm not worried. I'll see you in Hall, tomorrow." Ucal laughed. "So, go and start a fire inside the newly built barn in front of the Vee team's platform. Wood burns really fast."

"Yeah, and so does the tender flesh on my button hole. Naw." Dfee stared with a sour frown at the horses. The horses were excited and penned inside an individual stall, pawing the ground, neighing in fear.

Ucal frowned, "Why not?"

I gasped. "The horses will die."

Dfee laughed. "I will die."

"Do we kill the horses?" Ucal turned and frowned down at each horse on the other side of the arena.

Dfee exhaled. "You can't kill a horse with a fist, only a gun." The flash of bright light glittered from the sunlight and beamed into the eyeballs of Dfee. He turned and frowned at the object and the teen male that was standing on top of the Vee platform. "Awe, geez, Cousin Slim has a gun. I'm dead."

Ucal leaned over the front of Igala and shoved a hand into the chest of Dfee with a sneer, grabbing the object for safekeeping. "Go and start the fire and startle all the horses! So each horse will run over one of her long distance family members that I highly question, too."

Dfee lifted the other palm with the fire match, without releasing the hand of Igala and nodded with a smile. "Here is a grand idea! We should stop right now and ask for a DNA test to verify that these big and overgrown and stupid looking taller males really are her blood-cousins."

Ucal frowned. "Too late, Dewit! And didn't stump a boot toe into the on-coming pathway of a runaway horse, can you comprehend that order, Dfee? Then we steal one of the weapons from one of the other shooters, since we are not armed with nothing but a box of two matches."

Dfee laughed with a nod. "Then she'll come over and start a fire here with the same wooden strategy."

I smiled at Kallidin on top of the Vee platform. "Naw, she will not harm a horse. We kept our horses penned and safe underneath the Cee platform. And we stay on top of the platform. She won't let anyone harm a horse." I exhaled with worry. "I need to cut off the edge of my long pink colored gown. I can't ride a horse with a dress."

Dfee reached down and stored the fire match into a pocket, whipping out the switchblade from a different pocket, holding the blade in the air near his smile. "I will help my princess. Lift up the tail of the dress. Then I will whack it off."

I reached down and gathered the long skirt toward the front of my body with a smile and a giggle.

The hidden speaker inside the Bowl arena sounded the words. "Brood of vipers, you are condemned to Zulu Time."

The bell rang to begin the Bowl competition within the Zulu Time event.

On top of the Vee platform, one of the tall teen males stood in the middle of the platform with both boots apart, lifting and aimed the hand gun at Igala. The bullet launched through the air waves and sounded with a loud ping on top of the metal coated rooftop over the mini-barn of horses that was extended from the edge of the wooden platform.

On top of the Cee platform, Igala, Dfee, and Ucal swiftly dropped down onto the smooth wooden platform with a gasp.

"He missed." Ucal looked up with a smile and a laugh to see the teen with the gun.

"He almost didn't miss." I exhaled. "How are we going to..."

A new bullet discharged through the air waves toward the platform of the Cee team and sounded with a loud ping, ringing on top of the metal overhang of the mini-horse barn. The wooden floor rumbled with loud noises from the scared horses.

Dfee had accidentally dropped the switchblade over the surface with a sneer, looking at the shooter on top of the Vee platform. "O brother, he fired the gun with a bullet."

"O brother, he missed Dfee with the fired bullet." Ucal laughed.

I exhaled. "Stop it, both of you. We have no weapons here inside the Bowl."

"I got my switchblade." Dfee reached over with a smile. The second bullet discharged through the air wave and sounded with a loud ping, ringing the top of the metal overhang that stood over the top of the mini-barn with the horses. The wooden platform rumbled in loud sounds.

Ucal exhaled. "The horses are stomping over the soil and loudly neighing inside each individual barn stall with panic of the loud gun fire."

Dfee exhaled. "We need to release all the horses. I can ride a horse. I can use the horse it as a weapon and stomp them to death. Then we win the Bowl."

I frowned. "Kallidin can ride a horse, too."

Ucal laughed. "Not in that pretty party dress..."

I turned with a gasp to see Kallidin. She wore the same black tea length dress from Zulu Time with a pair of shiny black colored cowgirl boots.

Ucal laughed. "She looks like she might be attending a funeral..."

I snarled at her person on top of the Vee platform. "Yeah, hers..."

"We need a plan." Ucal frowned.

"We need a gun." Dfee laughed.

"We need a rescue." I exhaled and heard the next bullet as it fired through the air and landed on top of the metal rooftop of the horse barn with a loud ping.

"I will sacrifice myself for you, beauty." Dfee stood upright with a laugh and waved both hands at the shooter on top of the Vee platform. The bullet sounded throughout the air waves. Dfee slapped both hands into the chest cavity with a loud grunt and a louder curse, tumbling backward from Ucal and Igala. Another bullet echoed through the air and hit the edge of the wooden platform.

"No, Dfee!" I turned and gasped at Dfee.

Dfee screamed like a girl and lifted, slapping both hands over the chest for a second time, stumbling backward with a yell toward the solid wall, dropping down over the open edge of the wooden platform and rolled against the solid concrete wall. The edge of the wooden platform was not bolted into the wall. He fell over the edge of the wooden platform, disappearing from all eyeballs.

I gasped with worry, not seeing Dfee. "Dfee, he's been shot."

Ucal reached over and grabbed her arm, pulling Igala into his rib cage with a chuckle and a grin. "He's been, not shot."

"What?" I turned and gasped into the nose profile of Ucal.

On top of the Vee platform, Kallidin danced side to side on top of the platform in her cowgirl boots with a sneer, jabbing a finger at Igala, who rested on the stomach on top of the Cee platform. Kallidin turned with a laugh and pointed the wall with a snarl, where Dfee had fallen down. "One is down and two more to go. Go and kill her, now. Kill her, now..."

The male friend of Kallidin continued to stand upright and fire the hand gun at the people on top of the Cee platform with a grin and a laugh.

On the Cee team wooden platform near the solid concrete wall, Dfee partly fell down and partly climbed down through the wide crack of open space between the end of the wooden platform and the solid wall of concrete, climbing down over and tumbled down into the last horse stall. The horse scooted to the side in shock.

On top of the Cee platform, Ucal cuddled Igala with a smile and protected her from the shooter. "The hand gun has a range of five hundred feet, if that. We are more than two thousand feet from the shooter. The bullets fly through the air and landed on top of the metal rooftop over the horse barn by accident. The only thing that shooter is doing is upsetting the horses. They're going to kick down the stall door and then run around the soil in a panic. That will really get someone dead."

I turned and smiled at the Vee platform, looking at the mini-horse barn, "The horses? Dfee is correct. We can use the horses as our weapons. I can ride on top of one and stomp one member of the Vee team to death at a time."

He exhaled. "We'll never catch one of the horses with the rounds of live gun fire. They're too scared."

The shooter fired another bullet into the air. The bullet landed on top of the metal rooftop again. The wooden platform shook with noise from the set of three scared horses.

"Then we stop the shooter." I exhaled. "How many bullets are inside that hand gun?"

"Usually, a hand gun has six. But I bet that his body is wrapped with an ammunition belt that holds about two hundred bullets. Since that teen didn't have to stand inside the Zulu Time room. He ran out into the Zulu Time room for a brief introduction. Inside the Zulu Time room, each one of these teens was wearing an oversized pastel tinted sporting jacket and probably hiding the belts of ammunition from the Regulators. It really isn't against the law to tote or wear ammunition, only fire it at a Regulator. That act will get your dead for shore," laughing.

"Just great, I'll die in here Zulu Time for the last time."

Ucal cuddled her with a laugh. "Naw, we wait and watch for Dfee and the plumes of black smoke."

"Dfee has only two matches."

"And Dfee needs only one match to start a fire. And then we stay right here and wait on my..."

On the ground, inside the mini-horse barn underneath the Cee platform, Dfee reached up and grabbed the mane of the horse, lifting both legs into the air, slamming both boot heels into the stall door.

The stall door burst opened.

The horse raced forward toward the Vee platform in panic and fear.

On top of the Cee platform, "Dfee is loose." I turned with a smile and a cheer to see the horse. "The horse is racing across the soil toward the Vee platform with Dfee on the side."

Between the two platforms inside the dirt, Dfee rode on the side of the horse in a crouched pose, slightly hidden from the eyeballs of Kallidin. The horse of the Cee team turned to the side and avoided hitting the opposite closed door of the horse barn, running toward the rows of objects in the middle of the dirt field. Dfee jumped off and hit the side of the wall, sliding between the crack of space between the wooden platform and the solid wall with a snigger.

On top of the Vee platform, the single shooter turned and aimed the hand gun at the racing horse.

Kallidin turned with a gasp and snapped the leather whip backward, rearing it back behind her skull and slammed the gun away from the tall teen with a sneer. "Don't harm the horses, idiot. Continue to shoot the fools on the other platform." The gun launched to the side from his cupped hand and sailed through the air and over the platform, landing on top of the dirt inside the ground level of the Bowl arena.

The shooter back stepped with a sneer from the flinging leather whip and Kallidin, cuddling the wound into a chest. "I came here to kill. You don't do that again. Or I will kill you, girl. You understand me?"

"Go and get the gun and start shooting, now. I paid coin for you to do that." Kallidin continued to toss the whip back and forth into the air with a sneer, without touching the shooter, again.

The shooter turned with a sour frown and looked down at the gun over the soil, without moving.

A second shooter, a tall teen male stood next to the first shooter with a sneer and pulled out the hand gun with a set of gritted teeth, lifting and aimed the cold barrel at the two people on top of the Cee platform. He possessed a limited number of bullets for the kill job, not waiting to waste the good ammunition. The single bullet fired one at a time and landed on top of the metal rooftop of the mini-horse barn with a loud ping.

On top of the Cee platform, the two remaining horses reared and kicked the inner stall walls and door from fright. The entire wooden platform shook with violent motion.

I gasped with worry and felt fear like the two horses. "We can't stay here forever. We gotta help Dfee."

Ucal felt the quake of the platform and watched with a smile to see the running horse and the hidden Dfee. "We gotta wait for him to start the fire. Then the fire will spread over the wooden platform. Then we wait..."

I gasped. "Dfee fell off the horse. The horse is leaving without him."

"He ducked down into the wall space of the Cee platform. He's going to set the fire. So we sit still and wait..."

On the side concrete wall of the Vee platform, Dfee partly fell down and partly climbed down through the wide crack of open space between the end of the wooden platform and the solid wall of concrete, climbing down over and tumbled down into the last horse stall. The horse scooted to the side in shock. Dfee dashed to the stall door and reached down over the open stall and opened the door.

The far barn stall of the last horse underneath the Cee platform raced forward toward the Cee platform in panic and turned to the side, kicking its rear legs into the air from fright, galloping around the open space and followed behind the first horse.

On top of the Vee platform, Kallidin danced side to side on top of the platform with a smirk, wearing a tea length pretty dress in the color of rich black, jabbing a finger at Igala, who rested on a stomach on top of the Cee platform. Kallidin shouted with a sneer. "Get her. Get her. Kill her, now..."

The second teen that was paid coin by Kallidin stood with a pair of boots apart and continued to fire a single bullet from the hand gun at the two people on top of the Cee platform with a breath of frustration.

Between the Cee platform and the solid wall, Dfee leaned back with a snigger and climbed up into the rafters of the wooden platform and stopped at the top, staring down at the newly constructed bird nest of small twigs and green leaves with a smile, a perfect kindle for a fire. He gently waved the blue bird away for safety and reached over, grabbing the single match from the pocket with a worried brow. He had one chance to make it burn. He anchored a body between the slants and leaned over, lighting the single match on the top of the rough wooden plank.

It burned brightly in red and yellow colors.

He cupped a hand around the fire from extinguishing and slowly drew the hand toward the bird's nest. The fire caught and burned in an array of pretty blue and yellow tints. He gently fanned the fire. The bird nest blazed in bright red and yellow hues.

Dfee quickly leaned backward with a gasp from the swift flames and climbed up through the rafters, reaching over and wiggled over the first plank of the narrow crawl space between the top of the barn stalls and the wooden platform. He could hear Kallidin's footpads over the wooden platform of the Vee team.

Kallidin continued to dance and jab a finger at Igala with a sneer and a shout. "Kill her. Go and get her, now. Climb over on top of platform..."

Dfee swiftly crawled over the wooden planks, smelling the smoke of the burning bird nest. The other five horses smelled the smoke also and reared up and down, trying to break free from the enclosed barn stall.

Kallidin continued to dance over the platform, jabbing a finger at Igala, cracking the leather whip with one hand. "Kill her! Hit her with the bullet, now! Get her!"

On top of the Cee platform, I gasped. "Dfee is inside and moving across the empty crawl space of the Vee platform."

Ucal smiled. "He started the fire. Now, he will escape. So, we wait..."

"We need to help."

On the top of the Vee platform, the first horse at the end of the platform inside the first barn stall reared a set of front hoofs into the air and broke open a hole in the rooftop of its horse stall. The stall door opened. The horse ran forward toward the Cee platform and turned to the side, escaping the fire and the smoke, galloping toward the two rows of objects inside the middle of the dirt field.

The rooftop of the first horse stall broke away from the nailed planks and slid sideways down toward the ground, dropping Dfee down into the dirt also. He twirled sideways with a grunt and landed with a moan on top of a soft object, the back spine on the tall male from the Vee team.

The young teen male of the Vee team moaned in pain and dropped a face down into the dirt, semi-conscious, without moving.

Dfee rolled off the teen with a chuckle and stood upright with a smile, looking down with a grin over the back spine on the semi-conscious teen. "That worked out, beautifully. I don't plan that one. Now, only five more to go and torment, before I leave Zulu Time forever," he reached up and cracked all ten knuckles with a sneer.

The flying fist slammed into the rear skull of Dfee. He stumbled forward and smashed into the side of the barn, ricocheting off the wooden plank and spun around with a dizzy head to see the new assailant. He exhaled with a huff of silly whine at the new teen. "Yeah, you must know me good..."

"Yeah, I know your loud mouth and your weak reputation. Dewit, Defit, Defun, Dfee, that's me," the new teen laughed and reared, firing back a fist into the face of Dfee.

Dfee lifted both palms, too late. He spun around from the connecting face punch and dropped back down over the grass with a sissy whine, mouth spitting blood over the red dirt. "Yeah, that's me!" He shook the dizziness from the aching headache, standing upright with a wobble side to side and mouth spat out blood from a pair of busted lips with a mumble of pain, "You...good." The folded fist on the teen reared back and then missed the face of Dfee. Dfee dropped down toward the dirt and ducked to the side of the flying fist.

The new teen sneered and danced around side to side with an evil laugh. "Get fighting, Defeat! Come and smash my face in, Dewit!"

On top of the Cee platform, Ucal cuddled and protected Igala, staring down with a smile at the fist fight of the two teens in silence, without assisting his childhood friend Dfee.

I gasped. "We gotta go and help Dfee."

He continued to watch the fight with a laugh and a grin. "Tough teen Dfee is more than capacity of fighting and winning against that bigger and uglier teen. I don't want you harmed, gorgeous."

"Then, I'll stay here..."

The next bullet discharged through the air and landed on top of the metal rooftop with a loud ping.

Ucal exhaled. "And I'll stay, too."

I gasped. "Go and help Dfee!"

"Do you want me dead, gorgeous?"

"No." I meekly exhaled and watched the fight between Dfee and the bigger teen.

"Good, I stay and protect you. Dfee is winning." He cuddled her with a smile.

On top of the Cee platform, Kallidin stopped the dance steps with a gasp and stared down into the white colored smoke that was coming up from wooden platform, "Fire, fire! Get the burning fire out, now, now. Open each stall door. Get the horses out, now, now."

Each male jumped down from the Vee platform and spun around, racing to stand in front of a barn stall and opened the door. Each horse ran forward in a panic without hitting a teen and turned to the side, galloping around the inner space with the other two horses. Each horse followed behind each tail and run in a circle around the two rows of objects inside the middle of the dirt, kicking dirt into the air and flew by the dancing two teens.

Kallidin back stepped toward the opposite side of the non-burning wooden platform with a gasp and jabbed a finger down at the fire with a worried brow and a shout, lifting and snapped the leather whip into the air waves. "Put out the fire, now. Kill the fire, now. Smother the fire, now."

Each teen ran inside the barn stall and grabbed a blanket, spinning around and dashed toward the opposite side of the wooden platform beside the concrete wall and stopped, standing around and whipped the blanket, trying to smother the small red, yellow, and blue blaze.

On the ground dirt beside the edge of the Vee platform, Dfee back stepped from the flying dirt with a sneer, wiping the red colored earth minerals from a bloody and sweaty face. The Vee teen stood in place with a laugh facing the side of the broken barn stall on the Vee platform. "Is the little boy afraid of a little dirt?"

His eyelids darted to the side of the teen and watched the line of horses. He faced the teen, standing in front of the broken barn stall on the Vee platform, "Naw, only the flying horses."

The trail of horses run around the circle and then gracefully leaped into the air, landing one at a time. Then, the leader of the horse swiftly approached both Dfee and the Vee teen.

The Vee teen member frowned at Dfee. "What flying horse?"

Dfee laughed, "The one coming up behind your button hole, kid."

The Vee teen member spun around with a gasp to see the galloping lead horse. Dfee lifted and kicked a boot heel into the butthole of the Vee teen member. The teen ran forward into the galloping pathway of the horse. The first horse hit the teen. The teen spun around and dropped down, falling onto the dirt. The second horse stomped down into the chest cavity of the teen. The third horse leaped into the air and landed on top of the skull of the teen. The teen died in silence and blood.

Dfee frowned in silence at the dead Vee team member. "Four more to go..."

On top of the Vee platform, Kallidin moved backward from the plumes of black smoke and the yellow and red flaming fire with a gasp and stepped onto air on the edge of the non-burning side of the Vee platform, spinning around with a worried brow and halted on the solid edge of the wooden planks. She gasped down at the first dead Vee teen and the second unconscious Vee teen on top of the dirt, jabbing a finger at the back spine on Dfee with a sneer. "Get him. Kill, Dfee, now." The three other teens that were hired by Kallidin continued to fight the red and yellow fire flames, putting out the small blaze of heat and light inside the wall corner of the Vee wooden platform, before the entire Bowl arena caught fire.

Dfee spun around with a laugh and a grin to see Kallidin on top of the Vee platform.

"Wait!" Kallidin sniffed the air waves and turned to see the plume of black smoke on the opposite side of the platform, swinging around with a sneer to see Dfee. "You're poco loco crazy, Dfee. You have started a fire inside the Zulu Time arena. We're all trapped in here for the next fifteen minutes," she scanned the ground level and returned back to see the smile on Dfee with a worried brow. "There's nothing here but dry grass and tall weeds inside the Bowl arena. We all will die."

On the ground, Dfee tossed both arms into the air with a smile and then bowed at a fit waist, standing upright with a sour frown and a sneer. "Glad, I can accommodate your death, witch. Or I should say your death wish, witch. Or maybe, I should say your dang death wish, bitch."

Kallidin waved both arms and snapped the leather whip into the air, "Stop! Let him be. Put out this dang fire, before we all die of smoke inhalation." The other four teens from the Vee team continued to fight the fire as each one thought the same death concept.

The horses galloped around in a circle inside the dirt field. The leader of the horses turned and leaped through each ring with ease. The rest of the horses followed the leader. Then the leader exited the fourth and last ring, stomping down over the dirt, racing into a circle, again. The horse turned the side and leaped up onto a set of hind legs, hopping over the soil. The horse hopped into the air and jumped over the low fence post setting with an array of embedded colored flowers and a set of blue berry plants.

On top of the Cee platform, Ucal cuddled and protected Igala and stared down with a confused brow at each horse. "What is that?"

"Kallidin," I sneered at my former schooler friend.

"I am not looking at her. I am looking at the horses. Why are the horses running around the dirt like an oversized hopping bunny rabbit? Look there! Each horse jumps both its front legs and hoofs unto the air and then it hops, hops, and hops around the dirt. That is so strange."

I turned and gasped to see each horse, hearing the crack of the whip, swinging a face to see Kallidin.

Kallidin danced on top of the Vee platform and snapped the leather whip back and forth over her hair roots with a sneer. _"Get her. Kill her."_

Ucal turned and frowned at Kallidin. "And where did she get that leather whip?"

I gasped with a smile. "It's the shark."

He frowned. "What did you say? I didn't catch it."

"You told me that the Bowl always puts inside a surprise guest."

He turned and stared down at the soil. "Yeah, where is surprise guest? I didn't see it. What is it? Is it a nest of snakes? I like snakes even poisonous ones. They're very friendly to the environment, eating bugs and frogs and rodents."

"No, the guest star inside this Bowl event is the leather whip, not a snake or a squirrel or a squealing pig."

He turned and frowned at the leather whip inside the hand of Kallidin. "A leather whip? How did you figure out that one?"

I turned with a smile to see each horse over the soil. "These particular blond colored slender built horses are a set of dancing stallions, Ucal. They perform amazing acrobatic feats of jumps and leaps in the air, coming off the ground. Watch the horses!" The leather whip sailed into the air with a loud snap, coming from the hand of Kallidin on top of the Vee team platform. Then each horse reared up and stood on a pair of back legs, hopping forward over the soil like a bunny rabbit. I smiled. "The leather whip is controlling the motion of each horse like the shark patrolled the waters within the second Bowl. This is our weapon. This is our chance to fight back with Kallidin..."

Ucal frowned at the horse. "A leather whip?"

"Each horse must have a leather whip that is tied onto the mane of the neck. We need to ride on top of each horse to..."

He gasped. "Naw, I don't understand. Naw, I'm not a good rider of a horse. I like horses. But I can't ride a dancing horse."

I exhaled. "Alright, I'll ride the horse. You stay here."

He frowned. "Uh, I think that's a great plan. But can the horse jump about twenty feet into the air from the ground and over the top of a flat wooden platform without hitting the steel gates? I see that each horse can jump through that ring which is about three feet, coming up from the hard dirt ground. And each fence post is only about two feet up from the ground."

On the ground, a large edge piece on the far side of the Vee platform near the solid wall broke off and fell down over the dirt in a solid shape of rectangle and burning flames. The three Vee team members putting out the blaze ran backward with a gasp and spun around, running away from the fire flames.

"Get back on top of the platform. Come and stomp out the flames that are spreading over here near me. I don't wanna die. I don't wanna get burned. The rest of the fire is over here near me. Get back on top of the platform, before the horses kill you. The entire arena is burning down. Stop the fire. Come over here near me." Kallidin danced back and forth over the other opposite end of the non-burning wooden platform, missing the drifting plumes of black smoke, coughing with a sour frown and wiped the smoke from both eyeballs.

The three males, each Vee teen member stopped and turned, climbing back up the ladder on the side of the platform, ignoring the fight between Dfee and the other Vee teen member. Each one understood that the group of wild horses would kill any person in the dirt as the horses stomped and galloped, moving away from the fire, too, if the Vee wooden platform happened to completely drop down, landing on the ground.

On top of the Cee team platform, I turned and gasped with a smile at the burning piece of wood. "I got an idea. We do the same thing. We drop off an end piece of our wooden platform. Each member of the Vee team is standing on one side, near the edge of the platform near the dirt. But we aim the burning piece of wood at a slanted angle for the horse to run up the ramp and then leap into one or many skulls of each Vee team member. The horse can grab more height with a tilted upward ramp."

Ucal leaned over and kissed her cheekbone, pulling back with a smile. "You're brilliant, gorgeous. Good idea. And I got a surprise," he reached down and fumbled around inside the pocket of the blue jeans and lifted up an object near his smile. "I have the last fire match."

I turned and gasped at the object. "Where did you get that fire match?"

"Dfee, he slapped the other fire match into my hand, before he faked his death, falling off the edge of the platform, in case of the real death..."

"Don't wand a curse on him, Ucal!"

He smiled. "Take the fire match. Run down underneath our platform and fire up the wood. The platform holds lots of dry yellow weeds and dried bird shit, hanging out between the wooden planks." He stood upright on top of both kneecaps with a smile.

I continued to rest over the wood with a gasp of fright. "What are you doing? The teens still have the guns. You could get hurt or killed standing upright."

He turned with a smile to see the teens and Kallidin with a chuckle on top of the Vee platform. "Dfee set the fire. Now, the fire is still burning and crawling closer to each member of the Vee team. They are cuddled and huddled near the edge of the non-burning platform. Kallidin knows that the horses are running wild and free, smelling the smoke, too. She will not move off that platform, just cracking her whip in the air for drama and fright. The three other teens are trying to beat out the flicking fires from the top of the platform with a set of burnt blankets and a pair of hot boot toes. It's a funny sight to behold," laughing.

I turned and gasped at the Vee platform. "It is a funny sight to see."

He started bouncing up and down on top of the platform with a chuckle and a smile. "I'll stay up on top, bouncing up and down on top of the burning chunks of wood. The wooden platform is hollow near the edges. It will burn ease and fall quickly down over the ground. My cowboy boots will protect me. I hop like a bunny helping the burning weaken."

I turned and frowned at his boot toes. "What are you doing?"

He continued to bounce up and down with a grin. "I'm testing for a set of weak spots inside the older wooden planks. The fire will grab and consume the thin pieces of wood faster, burning at both ends. Then a piece of platform will fall, we plan our execution. This is our chance to burn. Kallidin is burning mad about the fire, the horse, and the defeat. Burn it, babe!"

"Yes, master." I rolled on a back spine and then a stomach over the smooth platform and away from Ucal without standing, dropping down inside the open space between the concrete wall and the last mini-barn stall wall, entering the crawl space and scooted forward over the thin planks inside the Cee team platform.

On top of the Cee platform, Ucal was jumping up and down, moving side to side. The crawl space underneath the platform dropped down a series of tiny individual chipped wood pieces and sprayed a set of fine dust particles of rotten wood around the sweaty face of Igala, sticking.

I continued to crawl slowly over the planks and batted the dust from both eyelashes with a cough of dust and stopped with a grunt, finding an assortment of dry tree branch twigs and yellow colored dried and dead moss. I reached out to strike the match and gasped. "I will get trapped between the fire and the wall." I slowly moved forward underneath the yellow dried moss and spun around, gathering the dress over my body. My sandals faced the ladder on the opposite end near the dirt. I could slide out and away from the slowing flames before getting burned. I reached down and struck the single match over the wooden plank, slowly moving the burning fire match into the dried kindle.

The dry moss and the tiny pieces of dropped kindle rapidly caught fire and smoked in white without burning into the colors of pink from heat.

"Dang, this will take forever. We'll all will not burn down and die." I reached down and ripped off fabric from the dress, tossing the short stripes into the fire. I planted a series of long stripes between the wooden cracks too. The fire burst into heated flame eating away on the stripes of clothing and produced black smoke. I coughed and swiftly shifted backward over the wooden planks. The horses were kicking and rearing inside the stalls. I gasped with panic. "The horses, get the horses out." My sandals hit air. Then I tumbled over the edge of the platform without hitting the ladder steps with a grunt, handing onto the end with my fingernails in free space with a sneer.

The fire blazed in pink, blue, yellow, and red colors, slowly spreading up and over the dry planks of wood.

I yelled. "Ucal..."

On the ground in front of the Vee platform, Dfee reared back and slammed a fist into the face of the third Vee teen member. The teen stumble fell backward and stopped, shaking a skull from the dizziness and charged forward, reaching out and wrapped both arms around Dfee. They twirled in a circle.

His eyeballs caught the vision of Igala. She was hanging off the edge of the Cee team wooden platform without support. Ucal was jumping up and down on top of the Cee wooden platform, stomping out a blaze of fire, ignoring her. Dfee gasped with worry, "Hey, my beauty is over there. I must rescue my princess." He jerked both biceps into the air and broke from the man-hug and the sour breath smell of the ugly Vee teen, lifting both arms and formed a giant fist. The giant fist dropped down and hit the back spine on the third Vee teen member.

The Vee teen member dropped down in the dirt with a grunt and a moan, not moving.

Dfee spun around with a smile and ran toward the dangling feet of Igala, stopping and stood behind the flowing pink dress of Igala, reaching out and grabbed both her legs. "Beauty, I'm here. Release your fingernails. I got you."

I hung from the edge of the platform and coughed, yelling with panic. "Horses, get the horses out of the stalls, now!"

He wrapped both biceps around her legs, "You, first."

I yelled with more panic. "No, get the horses out of the stall, first. They'll burn to death from the fire."

"Geez, okay." Dfee exhaled with worry and released both her legs inside the dress, back stepping from her dangling legs, scooting around the edge of the barn stalls and moved ahead to the first barn stall, stopped, standing in place with a cough and a sneer from the black smoke. He leaned over and grabbed the handle, jerking the door open. The horse reared into the air and landed down on the ground, running ahead and turned to face the rows of objects, galloping last behind the trail of running horses around the interior of the arena.

I slowly moved across the edge of the platform toward the built-in ladder. The ladder stood near the opposite end of the platform out of the way, connecting the dirt up to the top of the wooden platform. I released a cupped hand and reached down, grabbing the prong of the ladder securely, leaping down onto the lower prong with a grunt of fear, finally balancing an upright, wearing an evening dress and a pair of spiked heels. Not easy! I slowly climbed up the ladder toward the top to help Ucal.

Dfee moved ahead and stopped, standing in place, leaning over and jerked the handle up. The door bust open. The second horse ran ahead and turned away from the fire and the Cee platform, joining last in the trail of horses. The horses ran in a circle around the two objects in the center of the arena. Dfee back stepped and ran backward, stopping and scooted sideways, slamming into the bottom of the ladder. "I'm coming, beauty." He quickly climbed up the ladder and stood directly behind Igala, reaching out and grabbed her waist, lifting her up toward the platform. Then they climbed the rest of the ladder and landed top of the Cee team platform.

On top of the Vee team platform, Kallidin jumped up and down with fury. "They're standing up and moving around the platform. Stop them! Kill them! Get the guns and kill them," she coughed from the drifting black smoke and pointed at the red and yellow blaze of fire on the opposite side of the platform. "Kill the fire. Smother the fire. It's coming toward me. I'll be burned to death." She danced side to side in frustration without cracking the whip.

The two remaining teens of the Vee team stomped around the fire and whipped the burnt blanket at the fire without success, counting and wheezing from the smoke.

On the ground of dirt, the trail of horses continued to run around the dirt without jumping through the rings, smelling the burning fire smoke in fear and panic.

On top of the Cee team platform, Dfee stood in place near the rear of the platform with a confused brow, viewing the commotion. "It's on fire. Geez! Ucal started the fire on the wrong side of the field."

"I did it." I ran passed Dfee and stopped, jumping up and down on top of the smoke of the slow burning wooden plank, pounding the weak wood down toward the ground.

He moved slowly ahead with a smile and nod. "O well, that's okay, beauty. I'll help stomp out the fire." Dfee stopped and started bounding up and down on top of the wood near Igala. "Why did you start a fire on our safe platform, beauty?"

I continued to bounce up and down with a pant. "We're going to build a platform to Kallidin."

"O. That doesn't make perfect sense from the burnt wood. But I love you anyways, beauty." He continued to bounce up and down with a puzzled brow.

Ucal bounced over the smoke and the burning wood into her pathway with a grunt and a cough, wiping off the sweat and the ashes of gray from a face. "Rip off more of your dress and drop right here over the black smoke. The fire will catch hold and burn it through. Then we'll have a platform to Kallidin. Start the second burn, right here, Igala. I'll help Dfee continue to stomp down over the flames. You, go and get us some horses."

"Yeah, okay, on it!" I stopped the bounce and stood upright, ripping off more fabric from the long dress, dropping each strip down into the black smoke and burning wood with a cough and a sweaty face. The torn sections of ripped cloth ate the fire and flamed into more heat and light. I back stepped from the smoke and fire, ripping off dull pink colored evening dress fabric.

On top of the Vee team platform, Kallidin stood near the edge of the non-burning part of the platform, cracking the whip in the air with a sneer. "Put out the fire! Grab the guns and kill them." The remaining two Vee team members battled the fire with worry and sweaty faces. The fire continued to slowly burn each wooden plank on top of the platform.

On top of the Cee platform, I finished my task and spun around, gathering the ripped and torn hemline of my long dress and rushed toward the top of the ladder, swinging around and slowly climbed down each prong, jumping down into the dirt. My spiked heels stuck down into the dirt. I yanked each heel from the dirt with a grunt and spun around to see the horses. The horses run around in a circle, galloping around the two objects in the center of the arena.

On top of the Cee team platform, Kallidin stood near the edge of the platform, cracking the whip in the air with a sneer. "Put out the fire before I die..."

On the ground, the lead horse rounded the dirt and leaped into the air, jumping through the first ring. The other horses followed the lead, looking beautiful and elegant in the air.

In front of the side of the Cee platform on the dirt, I gasped with awe and watched the horses.

Each horse followed the leader and leaped into the air, clearing each ring. Then the leader turned from the ring and run down the opposite side. At the sound of the crack of the whip, the leader turned to the side and ran toward the first fence post, standing upright, hopping over each two-foot fence post.

I gasped with awe and smiled at each horse. "I need a horse. I see bushes of blue berries." I crouched down and dashed ahead toward the second fence post, slamming into the wooden post, leaning down into the vines, the flowers, and the blue berry bushes, cutting my hands on the prickly vines. My shoulder smashed and smushed into the wet fruit juice, spilling over my body and the dress. I ripped out another piece of pink dirty fabric and gathered a handful of fresh and smashed blue berries to capture one of the horses. I stood upright with a gasp and dropped back down into the fence post. The horses had run the length of the fence post course and was repeating the same obstacle at the crack of the whip form the hands of Kallidin. Each horse stood upright on two hind legs and hopped, clearing each fence post for second round.

I leaned down into the plants, eating the flowers with a gasp and closed my eyelashes, feeling the drips of sweat from the underbelly of each horse and the rain of dirt over my skull and both collar bones. The last horse cleared the second fence post. I stood upright and gathered the long dress, running backward from the fence post and stopped near the side wall of the Cee platform with a heavy breathes, watching the horses with a whisper. "I need a horse. They're both pretty and scared like Kallidin," laughing.

The leather whip cracked again throughout the air waves. The leader of the horses completed the fence post obstacle course and turned, running down on the side of the two platforms to perform another jumping maneuver. The last horse approached the Cee team platform.

I whispered. "This is it." I ran forward into the pathway of the last horse with fear and stopped in place. These particular horses had been trained to obey humans, not harming a human, either. The horse skidded to a halt and reared upright in annoyance of the human, standing on its hind legs, pawing the air, and dropped down onto the ground, halting in place. It stared at Igala.

I approached the stallion that was frisky and not frighten, standing quietly. I un-wrapped the torn pink fabric of my gown around a palm, extending an arm with the good smelling juicy blue berries. He approached with a set of flaring nostrils, smelling the fruit. I whispered with a smile. "Come on, boy. Come on to me. I got food. Smell the food? Calm down!" The stallion slowly approached and stood, sniffing the dirty fabric with the fresh blue berries. I reached out with the blue berries. The horse leaned down and sucked in the tasty blue berries, chewing. I reached up and grabbed the mane of horse hair, slipping over the naked back spine, leaning down into the sweaty hair with a stern face. I curled my hands around the hair strands.

The leather whip cracked with a snap in the hand of Kallidin.

My horse reared upright in shock and landed down onto the soil, racing ahead and turned to the side, running ahead toward the first ring. I leaned down over the sweaty hair of blonde colored mane, eating the hair strands with fright and excitement. The horse leaped into the air and jumped through the first ring with ease, landing onto the dirt. Then the horse continued to jump through each ring. I wrapped both arms around the neck and held on for dear life with grunt of pain from each landing impact.

The horse jumped through the last ring, stomping onto the dirt.

I reached down and gathered the loose dress train into a hand, tossing the arm. The dress train covered the eyeballs and the face of the horse. The horse halted in place with a series of snorts and neighs. I slid off and held onto the dress train, hearing it rip and stood upright. I ripped the fabric and tied the cloth, keeping the eyeballs of the horse blinded. The horse shifted side to side with a series of snorts and neighs with annoyance of fright.

I led the horse away from the row of rings and down the side of the two platforms and stopped at side wall of the Cee team platform inside the Bowl arena which was away from the smoke, the fire, and the other horses, tying the loose dress train on the horse around one of the tall overhead lighted poles that helped illuminate the Bowl arena within the night sky. "I need a second horse." I spun around and ripped off more strips of the dress, running into the pathway of another horse. The second horse reared and dropped down over the ground in snorts and neighs of confusion, not wanting to harm the girl. I extended the hand with the crushed blue berries. The horse leaned down to sniff the fruit juice. I sipped the torn strip of dress over the eyeballs of the horse. "Sorry, I'll feed you later, buddy!" I spun around and dashed to the second horse, hearing the loud crackle of timber and swung a face to see the Cee team platform.

Dfee and Ucal ran backward from the plumes of black smoke, the burning fire, and the shifting edge of the platform. Then the edge of the Cee team platform dropped down and landed on top of the ground, burning in red and yellow small fire. They back slapped and smiled at the new decoration of the Cee team platform.

On top of the Vee platform, Kallidin jumped up and down with fury and cracked the leather whip in the air with a sneer. "It broke off. The edge of the Cee platform broke off. Why are they doing over there?" She heard the crack of timber and stopped the dance with a gasp. A second piece of large chuck of wood broke off from the frame and fell down, landing against the concrete wall, ripping through the drawing on the wall.

On the ground, the trail of horses continued to run around the dirt and leap through each ring in beauty and fear.

On top of the Cee team platform, Ucal and Dfee moved forward toward the new edge of the platform, kicking at the burning edges toward the side of the wall for safety.

Ucal back stepped from the smoke with a cough and turned to see Dfee. Dfee disappeared over the edge.

On the ground, I saw Dfee fall down into the barn stall and ran forward with the horse, stopping at the edge of the platform with a yell of panic, "Dfee?"

On top of the Cee platform, Ucal ran forward and stopped, standing at the edge of the platform with a worried brow. "Dfee..." He leaped down and landed with bent kneecaps on top of the hay bales, tumbling down inside the first horse stall floor, crawling over and touched the bloody face of his friend, "Dfee."

Dfee rested on a back spine with a soft moan. "It fall." He wore a red mark on the cheekbone which would form a bruise tomorrow.

Ucal stood upright with a sneer and leaned down, jerking Dfee into the air and into a chest. "No time to sleep, boy. Get up! It's time to conquer Zulu Time. Igala got us two good horses."

Dfee moaned with dizziness pain. "Ugh."

Ucal exited the horse stall with Dfee and stopped with a sneer, standing beside Igala and the horse.

I leaned over and wiped the blood from his face with a whisper and a smile. "These horses are dancing stallions, Dfee. They perform acrobatic feats of jumps and leaps in the air."

Dfee opened and closed his eyelids from the dizzy headache with a goofy grin. "O. They fly through the air with the greatest appease...appeal...apple." He wiggled side to side inside the arms of Ucal. "What's the freaking word, Ucal?"

"Stop being a button hole for two whole seconds, bro." Ucal frowned.

Dfee smiled. "I like being a button for two whole years, then I move up to a button hole just like my childhood friend Ucal for the rest of my life."

I exhaled with worry. "Dfee, we're going to leap the horse up and onto the Vee platform and stomp Kallidin to death with the dancing stallion horses."

Dfee blew out a mouthful of blood from a bitten cheek with a set of closed eyelids. "That will be a fantastic feat, if you feat it," he softly chuckled.

I gasped. "Can you ride a horse?"

Dfee rested between the biceps of Ucal with a set of parted the lips and a goofy grin. "What in the halo? I'm a cowboy, man. I can ride any beast or babe."

"Shut it, Dfee." Ucal sneered.

The hidden Zulu Time speaker sounded inside the arena. "Brood of vipers, you are condemned to Zulu Time."

Ucal sneered. "I am beginning to hate that stupid phrase. Get on top of the dancing horse, Dfee! We're going to leap each horse from the wooden platform into the air and then knock Kallidin's head right off her shoulders."

On top of the Cee team platform, Kallidin gasped with a sneer down at Igala and her friend. "They didn't die. They survived the fall. Get the guns. Kill them." She stood on the edge of the non-burnt platform and continued to crack the leather whip into the air. Each horse leaped onto the rear hind legs and hopped, jumping over each fence post, landing at the end of the row, galloping in a circle to perform the trick again.

On the ground dirt, in front of the Cee team mini-barn, the horse heard the crack of the whip but didn't move. I continued to stroke the soft hairy forehead of the blinded horse with a worried brow. The horse would not run or jump, if it could see the ground.

Dfee closed and open his eyelids with a goofy grin and a slurry timber. "That will be a fantastic feat, if you feat it..."

I exhaled with worry. "He can't ride the horse..."

Ucal sneered. "Yes, he can ride the horse. He's natural horseman as a farmer boy. You control the whip, right? You said that the leather whip is the key to controlling the horses..."

I nodded with a worried brow. "Yeah, yeah, I said that. I'm right. I can control the horses with the whip."

Ucal sneered at Igala. "Good, then you snap the whip. Each horse will leap into the air and take off the skull of the three remaining Vee team members, including Kallidin."

The leather whip cracked into the air. Each horse leaped onto the rear hind legs and hopped, jumping over each fence post, landing at the end of the row, galloping in a circle to perform the trick again.

On top of the Vee platform, Kallidin jumped up and down with fury and pointed the top of the leather whip at Igala with a sneer. "They are right there, down there. Kill them! Get the guns and find the guns. Kill them!" The two other Vee teens battled the fire with broken planks and boot toes in frustration.

On the ground underneath the Cee platform, I reached out and pulled on the shirt of Dfee with a worried brow. "I'll go with him."

Ucal sneered. "No, I can't canter a horse."

I leaned over with a worried brow. "Dfee, canter the horse around the dirt and then head toward the ramp to pick up speed. The horse will rise up both its front legs, standing at a thirty-degree angle entirely on its hind legs. Then, the horse will balance on hind legs, before jumping. You must hold on to the horse mane. The horse will hop like a rabbit onto the ramp, keeping the forelegs off the ground and hind legs together and then give one or more of the Vee team members a good mule kick. You and horse will soar through the air and land on top of the Vee team platform. Stay on the horse. I will crack the leather whip again. The horse will hop upright again and continued to stomp each Vee team member to death. The horse will tilt toward the skyline, so you need to go up, not down." I shook his arm with worried brow and a worried heart. "Dfee, are you listening to me?"

Dfee smiled goofy with a slur. "Go up, not down."

Ucal chuckled. "The boy's get it." He lifted Dfee from the dirt and moved to the side of the horse, slipping Dfee over the naked back spine on the horse and back stepped from the horse.

I removed the blindfold. The horse turned away from the Cee mini-barn and Igala, running, following last behind the rest of the horses around the two objects in the middle of the arena with Dfee as the rider.

Ucal reached out and grabbed the arm of Igala with a stern face, pulling her toward the second stallion. "We gotta join the fun."

I swung around and dashed with Ucal to the other tied horse at the poles, stopping and untied the dress fabric strip, scooting sideways to the side of the horse. Ucal lifted Igala on top of the horse, climbing behind her back spine.

Over the ground dirt, Dfee bobbed back and forth on top of the naked back spine on the blonde colored horse, finally kicking the horse into a canter lope.

At the line of overhead lighted poles, I reached down and untied the leather whip from the horse hair, holding inside a right hand. Each horse was trained to response to the snap of the leather whip. I scooted near the hairy mane of horse, crushing the crinoline and silk gown into my lap, making room for Ucal.

Ucal climbed up and scooted behind her back spine on top of the horse with a worried brow. "Your dress is silk."

"Yes."

"I meant the silk is slippery against my jeans."

"Hang on! We ride with the wind." I jerked the horse away from the line of light poles, running down the side of the two platforms, catching up with Dfee and the rest of the horses, gathering speed.

On top of the Cee platform, Kallidin stopped the dance with a gasp and stared down at the member of the Cee team. "What is she doing?" She gasped. "Igala is riding one of the horses. Get me a horse, now. Jump down and off the platform and get me a horse, too." She stared at the riders on the horses. "Get me a horse, now, now..."

***

On the dirt ground, the first horse run and approached the stationary pile of burnt wood between the two platforms.

I lifted up and snapped the leather whip in the air with a loud crack. Each horse leaped onto a pair of rear hind legs and hopped over the soil. The leader of the horses turned and jumped onto the pile of burnt wooden planks, hopping over the sturdy planks toward an opening inside the wall. The torn visual opening showed a forest landscape of tall trees and short plant bushes. The lead horse leaped into the air and jumped through the new opening, disappearing through the torn section of the wall between the two platforms.

Each horse hopped over the burnt pile of wooden planks and leaped through the open hole also.

The horse of Dfee stood upright on its hind legs with a tail dragging over the planks. Dfee bobbed back and forth with a dizzy headache, holding the sweaty mane. Then his horse disappeared through the wall.

On top of the Cee platform, Kallidin gasped. "Where did all the horses all go? All the horses are gone but the one with Igala. What is that on the wall? A hole, there's hole on the wall. Dfee disappeared from the Bowl arena."

On the dirt, I circled the horse around the side of the fence post row with a gasp. "No!"

Ucal leaned over the collar bone of Igala with a gasp. "What happened? Where's Dfee? Where's the horse?"

I kicked the belly of the horse, building up speed for the same performance of Dfee with a stern face and a yell. "Hold on!"

He held her waist with gasp and a worried brow. "What are you doing?"

"I can't believe this. All the other horses ran up the burnt wooden ramp and hopped upright from my whip snap. But each horse didn't fly through the air and take off any bone skulls of the Vee team members. Each horse hopped up and down like a bunny rabbit on the sturdy pile of burnt wooden planks and then jumped over the short wall, ripping off the rest of the paper. Geez, there is only a paper with a drawing that covers the solid wall between the two elevated platforms. Why is that?"

He gasped. "That's the northern direction point within Society City Four. The Regulators must have used that wall to bring the horses into the arena and papered over it, not realizing that my girl is smart. That's the entrance portal of the asset of steel gates, heading toward the Society City One, the northern city of lights. It's a mountain range."

I grinned. "Excellent. Hold on to me!" I continued to sit upright and kicked the horse. The horse ran faster around the soil.

He held onto her waist, smelling her vanilla fragranced hair with a gasp. "What are you doing, Igala?"

I smiled. "We're going after Dfee. We're jumping through the hole and through the paper wall too. The horse is going to hop over the burnt wooden ramp and follow Dfee through the forests too."

"No, we can't leave..."

"Yes, we can..."

"No, we can't leave..."

I lifted up the leather riding whip over my hair roots, rearing it back, flinging the leather through the air. The whip sounded with a snap. My dancing horse stood upright and hopped over the soil without stopping, rotating both front hoofs over and over to maintain the brief stance.

On top of the Cee team platform, Kallidin looked down with a gasp at the leather whip. "It controls the horses." She lifted and cracked the whip into the air with a loud snap and a yell. "Get Igala on top of the horse. Kill her and him. Then we will win everything," laughing. The two remaining Vee team males spun around from the fire with a sneer and moved ahead, passing Kallidin over the solid portion of the platform, tumbling down the ladder and ran behind the single horse.

On the ground, the single horse with Igala and Ucal landed on the front hoofs down into the soil, running ahead and turned in front of the two objects, coming from the sound of the whip snap. I gasped with shock and reached up, cracking the leather whip. The horse stood upright and hopped over the soil. Ucal held onto the waist of Igala in silence. I cracked the whip for a third time. The horse dropped down over the soil and run around down the opposite wall from the two platforms. I kicked the horse to move faster.

On the top of the Cee platform, Kallidin stood on the edge, wearing the pretty party re-designer lace colored dress of black with a pair of black cowgirl boots with a sneer, rearing the leather whip back and forth into the air with a nasty yell and a loud crack. "Get her! Kill her!" She continued to slap the horse whip into the air.

On the ground, the horse reared upright and hopped over the ground. I gasped and cracked the whip. The horse dropped down over the ground and ran toward the Cee team platform.

Ucal yelled with worry, "I'm slipping off."

"Hold on to me, Ucal! I'm near the wood pile. We'll escape from the Bowl arena like Dfee."

"No! Don't do that, Igala." Ucal pawed at her waist with a yell and slipped down from the silk dress over the rump of the horse.

One of the Vee teens dashed toward the side of the horse and lifted, dropping down a hunting knife, cutting into the pink dress and sliced into one of the three layers of stuff crinoline that protected the leg of Igala.

I cracked the leather whip for a third time. The horse reared upright and hopped over the soil, rotating both hoofs in the air. The hoofs and body of the horse protected Igala and Ucal from the two Vee teens that held an individual hunting knife. The two Vee teens ran backward from the hoofs of the horse with a gasp of fright.

Ucal clawed at her waist with a worried brow and a gasp. "I'm falling off."

"Grab my waist, now!"

"Igala..." Ucal tumbled backward from the rump of horse and dropped down over the soft dirt onto a back spine with a sneer.

The horse hit the pile of tilted and burnt wooden planks, hopping on the rear legs toward the broken opening with the plastic drawing without fear. I looked back over a collar bone to see Ucal. He had fallen off the rump of the horse onto the dirt. The two Vee teen males surrounded Ucal with a set of loud sneers and dropping mouth spit. "No..." I yelled. The horse raced up the ramp and hopped upright, jumping through the paper and into darkness.

On the ground, the two Vee teens surrounded and sneered down at Ucal, kicking a boot toe into one of his numerous body parts. Ucal rolled side to side and grunted in pain and yells.

On top of the Vee team platform, Kallidin pointed down with a finger at Ucal on the ground with a sneer and a yell. "Don't touch me. Don't touch him. I'm coming. Don't touch him." She climbed down the platform. On the dirt ground, Kallidin spun around, running toward Ucal with a dance and a laugh, sliding into a stop and slammed into his rib cage. He grunted with pain. She squatted down with a tongue of sour breath and a sneer. "Don't kill him, yet. I get the final honor. Where did they go, Ucal? What's beyond the Zulu Time Building?"

One of the Vee teens turned and sneered at the hole in the wall. "It is forest, woodlands going in the direction of Society City One, if you hike by foot or ride by horse."

She looked up with a worried brow to see the hole in the wall and the rest of the bowl arena. "They are headed north. There are two fires, burning both platforms down to the ground. The rest of the horses are gone, too."

One of the Vee teen teens lifted both arms with a smile. "We won the Bowl, Kallidin. We got everything."

She shook her red colored ponytail and looked down with a sneer at Ucal. "We haven't won until he's dead. The team with the surviving players only wins. Igala and Dfee are gone outta of Bowl. But I can't stay and say the same for you, Ucal. Hold down both his arms and his legs and gimme a knife." The three remaining squatted and grabbed the limbs of Ucal. One handed Kallidin a knife.

On top of the Cee team platform, the set of steel doors cracked and slid open. Three rows of golden tinted Regulators emerged with a single short Regulator in the lead. The short Regulator halted at the burnt edge of the platform and lifted a golden glove into the air in silence. The first two rows of Regulators kneeled down and shouldered a rifle at the teens. The short Regulator dropped down to the platform out of harm. A flash of numerous bullets discharged from each rifle of a Regulator at an upright Vee team member that surrounded Ucal.

On the ground, Kallidin looked up with a gasp and stood upright over the body of Ucal, waving both arms and the knife at the rows of Regulators. A single bullet hit and exploded her skull into red blood, white bone, and gray tissue. The two other Vee teen members stood upright and turned with a gasp to see the three rows of glittering golden Regulators on top of the Cee platform as a set of bullets raked each body into blood and death. The three bodies dropped down and fell over Ucal and the dirt.

On top of the Cee team platform, the bullets ceased. The knelt Regulators stood upright in silence. The short Regulator stood upright in silence. All the Regulators but one turned and moved down the ladder, dropping down over the soil, moving ahead to the dead members.

Two of the Regulators jogged ahead and split, veering toward one of two unconscious bodies over the dirt and stopped, standing over the unconscious Vee teen member, lifting the hand gun, releasing the trigger. Two separate bullets discharged and killed each teen into death.

The other Regulators carried a medical stretcher for each dead teen that had competed inside the Bowl. These Regulators stopped and squatted, loading a dead body onto a medical stretcher, slowly swinging around, moving out of the Bowl arena.

The entire Vee team member of six teenagers would now celebrate a final resting place in the Vee Building inside a dark and cold pink tinted marble tomb, tonight.

Back inside the court house building inside the morgue room, the door slid open.

The short Regulator moved inside first and stopped, standing at the end of a table, pointing down at the medical stretcher on top of the examination table inside the morgue room without a smile and an emotion. "Thank you. Please depart." The four tall Regulators turned and exited the room.

The door closed shut.

She turned and stared down at the teen. His face was bruised in blue colors and covered in flakes of burnt grass. His blue jeans and his shirt were ripped and torn covered in red blood, blue berry juice, and brown dirt. She leaned with a whisper without smile into his face, "Ucal."

"Mom." Ucal coughed with a grunt.

She said. "Are you hurt?"

"No."

She nodded without a smile. "When I meant to destroy Zulu Time, I did not mean it literally, Ucal."

"Sorry, Mom!"

She said. "You are alive, most importantly. Stay put! I am fetching your dad and some of our trusting kind. You will be safe, now, son."

"I want Igala safe, too, Mom."

She stood upright and reached down, patting his shoulder with a nod. "She will be safe, too."

11:11 pm (late evening)

Outskirts Zulu Time campus

Woodlands forest setting

Cool temperatures with dull moonlight and bright stars

The horse leaped through the plastic sheet on the wall inside the Bowl arena, over the short rows of plant bushes, and finally landed down into a field clearing, galloping ahead and around each tree for fun.

I narrowed my eyelashes seeing Dfee. The Zulu Time arena was behind my butthole. A grove of trees was ahead of my eyeballs. I slapped the belly of the horse with both feet, charging the stallion into a full gallop, chasing after Dfee. I leaned down into the blonde colored mane, tasting the course hair, smelling sweat. I kicked the plump belly of the beast, overtaking the running stallion and steered my horse right into the nostrils of the other beast and reached out, grabbing the ear of the stallion.

The stallion stopped.

Dfee fell forward over the hairy mane of the hair with a loud grunt.

I slipped off the horse and ran to Dfee, grabbing his arm, pulling down his heavy body toward my chest. He fell sideways into Igala. Then, Dfee and I both dropped down and landed on top of the soft grass with a heavy grunt.

I leaned over and kissed his lips with a whisper. "I'm standing up. I need your help. I can't tote you like a pretty flower bouquet." He grunted in pain. I stood upright and leaned down, helping Dfee to stand, leaning him against my shoulder with a puff, dragging him toward the open field and away from the two stationary horses. The rest of the horses ran around in a circle, kicking wildly and singing in heavy neighs of fun. The horses had been trained around humans, staying close to one, without running away. I didn't want Dfee harmed from the dancing stallions.

I shuffled ahead and away from the dancing horses and stopped, dropping Dfee down onto the grass, squatting down to see his face. I reached out and jerked off the com-d of Dfee from his wrist bone and stood upright and turned, dashing back to the first horse. I reached out and tied the com-d onto the hair strand of the mane of the horse. Then I lifted a leg up into the air and ripped off some of the dully pink gown into strips, dropping down the leg. I reached over and used the ripped fabric, tying it onto the horse. I turned with the horse and stopped, at the nearest tree with my new plan. I reached down and shimmied out of one of the crinolines, lifting it the air and moved to the second horse. I reached out and tied the crinoline onto the hair of the horse, moving and tired the second horse to another tree.

Now, the group of hunting Regulators could track the electronic beep, coming from the com-d of Dfee that rested on the single horse, bringing them toward the ancient rail box car.

I turned to face the playful stallions and slowly moved forward, waving both arms with a yell, screaming at the horses. Each one turned and ran away from Igala, dashing into the thick woodlands with panic and fear.

I halted in place, exhaling and inhaling with heavy breaths of worry and fear, mustering some extra strength and spun around to see Dfee. I slowly moved to Dfee and stopped, leaning down and lifted him from the ground, leaning him onto my shoulder.

They moved forward toward an old abandoned rail box. A long time ago, the railroad train traveled through Society City Four, transporting goods and livestock, since the invention of the hover craft and the re-generation of food and re-generation merchandise, the ancient rail system had died away.

The ancient railbox car did not possess a set of rolling wheels, standing level and stationary inside a pasture of tall red and green weeds and in front of a grove of shade trees.

The railbox car door was open.

I stumbled with Dfee over the rotten wood floor and stopped, standing a few feet inside the dark interior. My eyelashes saw a set of old stuff sacks of garbage on the short side wall and a pile of old wooden furniture on the opposite long wall. I slowly moved forward with Dfee toward the opposite wall between the old furniture pieces and stopped, gently dropping him down over the floor onto his back spine, leaning over with a worried brow and a worried heart, "Dfee." I lifted his shirt and probed, touching his naked body with my warm hands for an open wound or a bloody cut. "Dfee, are you bleeding? Do you feel pain?"

"Dizzy." He weakly moaned in pain.

I reached up and touched his forehead with relief. "You got a concession, darling." I didn't feel a sizzling fever or hot temperature from his body. I stood upright and scanned the interior of the space. The dark railbox was a perfect hideout for the night while I figured out our next step. I moseyed toward the short side wall of tan colored cloth sacks and squatted down at the first one, hearing a faint scratching sound.

A rabbit hopped out from behind the short cloth sack and stopped, sniffing the air waves and Igala.

I stood upright and eased over the short row of dull and torn cloth tan colored slumping sacks. There was an entire family of brown colored rabbits, hiding and feeding off the stale corn mill. I exhaled with a puff of worry and stood upright, turning with a worried brow to see Dfee, not being able to hide his entire body behind the cloth sacks for protection.

I back stepped from the row of sacks and the short side wall and swung around to face an array of office furniture with a set of rolling chairs, several office desks, and three office credenzas. I moved ahead and touched the entrance wall. The entrance doors provided outside light and protection with a sliding door of rotten wood. I spun around and stared at the opposite wall of furniture items, moving ahead between the two low office credenzas and the three office desks that were crowded into the wall corner.

"Yes." I leaned down with a smile and shoved the empty office desk with a grunt, moving the desk away from the wall corner, revealing a small amount of empty space. "Yes." I stood upright and leaned over, shoving the office desk toward the credenza. The thick credenza weighed more than a horse, making that feat impossible. I stood upright and turned, pushing with a huff and shoved with a grunt the two other office desks away from the wall corner, standing upright and turned to see Dfee. He was sleeping and mouth drooling away his dizziness of the head concession.

I back stepped from the new hideaway and turned, moving ahead to Dfee, squatting down, running both arms underneath his armpits and dragged his body with a grunt between the space of the wall corner and the two desks, tucking him nicely into the wall corner. Then, I stood upright and spun around, scurrying out the railroad boxcar entrance door into the late evening toward the loose grounded brown dead and green healthy tree leaves. I stopped and squatted down, reaching out and gathering two handfuls of dry brown and healthy green leaves, shaking out the bugs and spiders, hopefully. I stood upright and spun around, dashing back into the boxcar, gently tossing the tree leaves underneath the two office desks, needing more disguising materials.

I spun around and ran outdoors for a second time, stopping, squatted down and gathered another handful of dry brown colored and green healthy tree leaves, shaking out the bugs again. I stood upright and swung around, dashing back into the railcar and stopped, dropping more tree leaves around the entrance floor of the railroad boxcar like the wind had shoved them into the opening.

I back stepped and stopped inside the archway of the boxcar, staring at the new hiding spot.

I snapped the fingers and dashed ahead to Dfee with a smile, stopping and squatting down, pulling off each of his brightly colored cowboy boots. I cuddled the boots and stood upright, turning and moved back toward the short row of cloth sacks, squatting down, positioning a boot at the end of the cloth sacks like Dfee was hiding from the bad villain. I stood upright and spun around, moving to the entrance door, sliding the door partly shut like Dfee was hiding out from the bad villain.

I spun around with a giggle and returned back to Dfee, leaning down and pulling him into the wall space, back stepping and spun around. I reached down and shoved, sliding the two office desks into a semi-straight line, squatting down, scattering all the brown and green colored tree leaves underneath the desks. Then, I gathered and spread some of the brown and green colored tree leaves over his blue jeans and the pair of white socks of Dfee.

I stood upright with a sigh of hard work, turned around and tiptoed over to Dfee, spun around again, slamming a body into the wall corner, slumping down into the tiny part of the corner wall with exhaustion. I lifted and rested the blonde haired rear skull of Dfee into my lap with a smile, gently patting his dirty forehead. He needed to rest from the head concession, bouncing his brains back and forth from the fight with the numerous teen males from the Vee team. I closed eyelashes and relived the nightmare inside the Bowl arena.

Ucal had fallen off the horse, when I had reared the stallion into the air for our escape from the Bowl arena. I heard all the gun shots, too clearly. Now, Ucal was dead. Lexedo had murdered him in cold blood and defenseless with her gun. Ucal didn't carry a weapon inside the Bowl arena.

I opened my eyelashes, staring through the thin crack of the railroad boxcar, seeing the dark night sky. Zulu Time was unfair and unjust for an innocent person. I was not a criminal. I reared end a stupid car, not a human.

Then, my family had been invited into Zulu Time. Then I had substituted for my family, killing inside Zulu Time. I had killed the mother of Minki inside the salty water pool of the Bowl. She had died in the water. I couldn't see the blood, only feel the pain.

Ucal had substituted for the biological family member of Igala and killed inside Zulu Time, too.

One of the best girl pals of Igala, Minki had tried to kill Igala inside Zulu Time for the Smith family property and possessions.

Zulu Time was not the judge and the jury for rightness, but wrongness.

I exhaled with a puff of worry and needed to focus and develop a plan for tomorrow. Dfee and I will leave the woodlands and settle into another small town outside one of the Society Cities. I turned and smiled down at his handsome face, feeling love and safe. He and I would start a new life together, without Zulu Time, which was the only way to escape Zulu Time.

I closed my eyelashes and leaned against the wall, deciding at dawn.

At 11:33 pm (late night) among the cool temperatures with moonlight and bright stars, a single gunshot sounded in the close distance.

I awoke with a gasp and a whisper into full consciousness, leaning over the corner wall with Dfee inside my lap with a whisper for my eardrums only. "They killed the horse." I heard another single gunshot sound within the closer distance. I whispered for my eardrums only. "Dang, they found the second horse."

The door of the railroad boxcar slammed open with a loud boom, admitting a set of four glittering golden shadows inside the archway that beamed from the ray of a full moon and numerous bright stars of a clear night.

I couldn't see each face, only felt the thunder of each boot heel. Each one entered the railroad boxcar interior and stopped in place, scanning the darkness. I reached down and placed a hand over the mouth of Dfee, feeling appreciative that he didn't snore.

The first glittering golden shadow, the Regulator veered toward the short side wall with a chuckle and stopped in front of the short row of tan colored cloth sacks. "Boots, there's a pair of boots over here. We found one." He reached down and fired the hand gun with a set of whamping sounds down into each cloth sack.

Dfee wiggled side to side and awoke with a gasp from the gun noise. I pulled him into my breasts, pressing a hand over his parted lips. He stared up into the chin of Igala with worry. But I did not move and held my breath of fear.

A second glittering golden shadow, the Regulator rushed ahead and tossed each sack into the air and from the short side wall with a chuckle. Each sack landed behind his back spines. "Rabbits, you aimed and killed a family of rabbits. I'll finish them off and then take them home for a rabbit stew, tomorrow night." He squatted down and stabbed each one with a sharp blade, hauling the dead body into a bag over his shoulder with a nasty laugh.

The third glittering golden shadow, the Regulator stood inside the archway with a sour frown. "These criminals are smart. That's why they're criminals."

The fourth glittering golden shadow, the Regulator looked at the rabbits with a puzzled brow. "What did you find?"

A fifth glittering shadow, the Regulator appeared and stood inside the archway beside the fourth glittering golden shadow. "Why did you kill the two horses? They were not runaways."

The second glittering golden shadow of the Regulator laughed. "He found a pair of worn cowboy boots."

The fifth glittering shadow of the Regulator looked down and read the com-d. "His com-d was tied around the horse hair like a ploy. Her dress was wrapped about the hair of the horse, too. They stumped us. There is some movement, north of here. That's them. They are settled onto the other horses, moving north. That's where we will find them. Let's go!"

The first glittering golden shadow of the Regulator spun around and moved through the archway. "The old railroads system used to drive through Society City Four. This setup is a ploy for their play fun. So, they're heading north on the running horses. Call up the rest of the teams and tell them to block the steel gates into Society City One." The Regulator exited the rail boxcar.

The second glittering golden shadow of the Regulator spun around with the bag of dead rabbits and moved toward the archway. "They're young criminals. No coins. No food. Let's get going." The second Regulator exited the rail boxcar also.

The rest of the glittering golden shadows of Regulators back stepped from the archway and left the stationary railroad boxcar, loading back onto airships and moved toward Society City One.
287th day of the current year

Society City Four

12:03 am (early morning)

Railroad boxcar interior setting

Cool temperatures with bright moonlight and bright stars

Dfee and I rested over the floor in the darkness for thirty minutes, ensuring that the woodlands were peacefully quiet. Dfee wiggled his toes with a sour frown. "My boots..."

"...saved our lives." I smiled. "Can you stand? Are you feeling dizzy or sick?"

"No." He sat upright and leaned over, cuddling Igala with a whisper and a stern face. "I think we should stay right here inside the old boxcar for the night until morning, beauty. Sleep until dawn and then move out."

I reached down and tickled his naked belly with a smile. He wiggled side to side with a chuckle. I exhaled with a new order. "You're fine. Get up, Dfee. We're going to find some answers."

Dfee stood upright and leaned over, shoving the office desk over to side for walking space. "And, beauty, where are we going? I wanna head to west and into the forestland and steal us some food. Then, we hike it toward the closest house and steal us a hover car. Then, we leave Society City Four and Zulu Time all behind our buttonholes." He moved ahead and spun around. Igala moved ahead and walked into his open arms with a smile. He spun around and moved toward the sacks of spilled corn and the blood of the dead rabbits with a smile. "Beyond Society City Four in the rural countryside, I'll steal us some com-d. You can call your mom and your dad and say goodbye."

I frowned. "That's our second plan. Our first plan is to view Ucal's grave."

He stopped and leaned down, reaching out, grabbing his boots with a stern face. "Ucal's grave?" He stood upright and sat down over the floor, replacing both boots over the socks.

I exhaled with sobs and tears. "He fell off the horse, when it reared, falling down right into the two deadly hands of Kallidin. I heard the gun shots. She...he..."

He stood upright with a sad brow. "I..."

I led outside with tears and stopped, standing in the grass, wrapping both arms around a body. Dfee emerged from the railroad boxcar and pulled up beside Igala, cuddling her with a stern face. I exhaled with sobs and tears of sadness. "How long to hike it back to Zulu Time?"

He cuddled her and turned to see the far distance of the Zulu Time campus. "We're about two miles. That's about thirty minutes in your heels. I can carry you, beauty." Dfee turned with a smile to see her nose profile.

I exhaled with sobs and tears. "I'm fine until I need you to carry me. Will there be Regulators posted as guards around Zulu Time campus and the buildings?"

"No, everyone eats food, lives in house, and sleeps in a bed."

I exhaled with a sad heart and a sad face, "But the dead..."

He exhaled with a worried brow. "You don't have to visit Ucal. He's dead. We can't do anything for him."

I reached over slapped a hand into his chest with a sad face and a sharp tongue. "Ucal saved our lives. It's the dead of the night, even the other Regulators have stopped hunting for us, waiting at the steel gates around the landscape for us. They're all one dimensional."

He exhaled with a tight smirk, "Right, beauty." He spun around with her and moved through the forest landscape with a worried brow.

Thirty minute later, they exited out the forest and entered the first paved city street, moving swiftly between the dark alleyways of the tall building within Society City Four, watching and listening for a roaming Regulator or two. However, there was no crime within the city limits, only peace and cool temperatures of bright moonlight of a romantic night.

Dfee cuddled her closer into a chest and scanned the empty streets, moving swiftly toward the Zulu Time campus with a worried brow and a worried heart in silence.

Vee Building location

01:01 am (early morning)

Cool temperatures of clear sky with bright moonlight

Entrance door setting

They exited between the buildings underneath the bright moonlight. The city streets were empty. The rest of the citizens of Society City Four were at home and asleep inside a warm bed mattress.

Dfee advanced forward and cuddled Igala into a chest, staring at the wooden doors of the Vee Building with a worried mind in silence.

I turned and scanned the city streets, the moon, and the wooden doors of each building with a whisper. "Are you certain that no Regulators are present in here?"

"Positive." He shuffled with her toward the closed doors of the Vee Building with a worried heart and a worried mind.

The doors automatically opened for the new visitors into Vee Building.

They slowly entered through the archway and moved down the pink tinted marble hallway in silence. The atmosphere of the hallway was a creepy and quiet.

I gasped with a whisper into his eardrum with a worried brow. "Why are the doors not locked and sealed in here?"

He moved down the pink floor with a smile. "The dead only walk inside a pretend and made-up entertainment movie, beauty." They continued to stroll down the pink marble that reflected the bright light from a series of burning urns against each wall. He smiled. "In case, a visitor wants to pay their everlasting respect to the dead friend or extended family member."

"I do know that the entire family unit is killed during Zulu Time."

"That's why the doors are always open, since the entire family unit doesn't exist to visit, themselves," he softly chuckled.

"The hallway is chilly and quiet. That's both stupid and illogical, Dfee darling."

He exhaled. "Maybe, this isn't a good idea to be in here, right now. Maybe, we should leave from here, right now."

I exhaled. "We're here. We should pay our last respects to our good friend Ucal and then leave. How will we get out of Society City Four?"

He advanced down the hallway and cuddled her with a stern face and a worried hart in silence.

I continued to move and cuddle with Dfee, turning with a confused brow and reached out, touching the smooth and cool wall of pink tint granite. "The walls and the ceiling are much, much shorter than the Cee Building. This wall is no higher than five feet high without touching the ceiling."

He frowned. "The Cee team never ever survives Zulu Time. So, the Vee Building never ever holds a set of growing tombs for the dead."

"It looks exactly the same with the series of continue burning urns except the marble is pink, instead of white."

He stopped and stood in place, turning to face the wall of granite, searching with his eyelids. "The buildings are the same dimensions in length, not height."

She stopped and cuddled into his chest, turning to face the granite wall with a confused brow. "What are we doing?"

"The tombs are labeled in alphabetical order. We're standing at the letter T which is located closer to the double doors of the Vee chamber rooms." He pointed to the tomb of the dead on the side wall. She turned and viewed the wall plague that stated the name Tate. Dfee side stepped and read each plague on the wall, double checking each name. They quickly reached the end of the pink wall of the dead. He frowned. "He's not here."

I spun around with a puzzled brow and stared at the end of the opposite wall. "Is it alphabetized in last name? Let's start at the beginning. I don't know anyone on this wall."

He nodded with a stern face. "It is alphabetized by first name." He reached out and touched the specific tomb with a sour frown, "Zug."

"That's not Ucal's last name, is it?" I released his hand with a stern face. "I'll go back and double check, starting with the letter A." I turned and dashed down toward the other end near the silver tinted entrance doors into the suite of rooms, stopping at the beginning of the wall of pink marble, searching for the name of Ucal. I stopped with a gasp and reached out, touching the plague with a stern face and a whisper, "Minki?" I reread the plaque with a whisper, "Minki, she is really here. She is really dead." I shook my curls and side stepped to the next letter O with a gasp, swinging around to see the opposite wall of the dead. I veered to the end of the wall and dashed ahead, stopping with a gasp to see the letter L, shuffling backward over the names and stopped with a gasp. I reached out and touched the plaque with a sad face. "Kallidin, she is really here. She is really dead. Ucal killed her second, because she was trying to kill me first. That means..."

Dfee spun around with a smile and dashed into the back spine on Igala with a whisper. "He's not here."

"Minki, her name plaque is back there on the opposite wall with the lower letters of the alphabetic. I don't understand."

He frowned. "She died inside the Bowl with you and Ucal inside the first Bowl."

I frowned. "I know that. I don't understand why Ucal is not here."

He thumbed back over a collar bone with a stern face. "The name Zug is one of Kallidin's tag team mates whom I fought with. He beat me up pretty good until we escaped from the Bowl arena. I remembered him from the Hall class ahead of us."

I spun around and dashed back to the opposite wall, stopping and stood in front of the plaque, shaking my curls in silence. Dfee turned and followed behind the back spine on Igala and stopped beside her with a sneer, reaching out and touched the tomb. "Minki, that witch is really dead."

I gasped. "Is this a fake tomb?"

"No, Zulu Time is not fake or fun. The bitch is really dead." He swung around with a smile and hugged Igala. "And Ucal is alive. I can't find his name on this wall of pink."

I gasped and stared at the pink wall. "How is that possible, Dfee? I saw Ucal being attacked by the remaining team mates of Kallidin. It was three against one. Maybe, his dead body is inside another tomb but not labeled yet."

He stared at pink wall with a stern face. "No, beauty. They place all the dead bodies of the families inside the tomb grave, immediately. So, all the assets of the dead bodies of the families can be distributed, more immediately."

I gasped. "They place all the dead bodies of the families inside the tomb grave, immediately. What does that statement mean?"

He exhaled. "Well, I didn't want to mention this during the Tag Team."

"Mention what, Dfee?"

"Well, the Tag Team concept is rarely used, because when the team loses inside the Bowl arena, then the entire family is killed."

"What?" I gasped. "That's so sad. The entire family of Kallidin is with her inside that tomb grave..."

"And Zug's family and the five other teen males..."

"What? Why?"

"That is the rule of the Tag Team. That is why it is rarely called. When one member challenges the Tag Team, the entire family unit of mama, daddy, brother, sister, aunt, uncle is all at risk of death too."

I shook my curls with a stern face. "But the family unit of Kallidin was not inside the Bowl with us when we escaped."

He exhaled. "Well, I didn't wanna tell you this."

"Tell me what?"

"The entire family unit of dead Kallidin was rounded up by the Regulators and brought into Zulu Time, immediately. They were probably killed on the wall of criminal a few moments later, after we escaped and after the Regulators had killed the rest of the Vee team members. That's the rule."

I gasped. "And the families of Zug and the other five teens that worked for and conspired with Kallidin."

"Well, I didn't wanna tell you this."

"Tell me what?"

"The entire family unit of dead Zug was rounded up by the Regulators and brought into Zulu Time with the same dead outcome on the wall of criminals, too. And the entire family member of the other three teen males, they are with their individual dead son inside this pink wall of the dead." He reached out and patted the tomb with a stern face.

"Unbelievable."

"Believe it! That is the Tag Team rule. That's why it is rarely called out to fight and to win."

I gasped. "Then, Ucal is really dead, too. And his parents are really dead, too. But we didn't find his name here. And his parents are Regulators. How is that possible?"

He snapped the fingers with a smile. "It is not possible." Dfee reached down and grabbed her hand, turning with a chuckle to face the long hallway and the twin wooden doors. "We go to the Cee Building. Ucal, me, and you were the Cee team, not the Vee team."

"O. So I really do get to see the wall plaque of Ucal." I moved slightly behind the back spine on Dfee and sobbed with a set of tears of sadness.

Dfee swiftly strolled toward the entrance doors. The doors opened. He turned to the side with a grin and moved over the outside pavement toward the wooden twin doors of the Cee Building.

01:31 am

Cee Building location

White colored marble with tiny golden specks

Cold temperatures without sunlight

Hallway setting

The entrance doors automatically parted for Dfee and Igala.

He swiftly moved down the hallway with a grin and stopped in front of the wall of the dead, seeing the letter U, slowly shuffling side to side to see each tomb plaque with a smile. He shuffled down to the end with a nod and then shifted back the other way, passing the letters Z, X, Y, U, T and stopped with a chuckle.

I gasped. "He's not in here. I didn't see the name of Ucal inside the tombs with the letter U."

He reached around and wrapped both arms, lifting Igala from the floor into the air with a hoot and a smile, twirling in a completed circle and dropped her back down to the floor with a nod and a grin. "That's mean, beauty. We won Zulu Time."

I gasped with a stern face. "We won?"

He cuddled her and nodded a chin toward the wall of dead with a smile. "The Cee team won. Ucal won the Bowl for us."

I gasped. "But we escaped from the Bowl."

He nodded with a smile. "So we were the two dare devils of the entertainment show of Zulu Time. Ucal was the last man standing up against Kallidin."

"There couldn't been more of Kallidin's tag mates standing and breathing, too."

"No. If a tag mate was standing or sitting or bleeding, but breathing, then the Regulators executed him on site inside the Bowl arena over the dirt."

"O mercy. That, that's how it all works."

"O mine. That's how it ends. Yes, the Vee team is taking the chance that they will win, everything. Then they are taking the risk that they will not lose, anything. I mean every limb, skull, and heart," he soft chuckled.

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance and stared at the wall of white marble with each dead name and associated group of dead bodies. "You're heartless, Dfee."

He frowned. "That's the way it all works."

"But we were discussing leaving Society City Four inside the ancient railroad boxcar."

He leaned over and kissed her lips, pulling back with a smile and a whisper. "I am just stating all the true facts about Zulu Time. But I will not lose you, Igala. If that means that we move from Society City Four and live within the trees and forest with the little bear cubs."

"Bear cubs are not tiny. And they grow up to be big mean bears." I softly giggled with a grin.

He frowned. "I will not lose you, beauty. I love you."

"I love you, beast. So we can go back home."

He yawned with bad breath. "Home, I'm too emotional, too pooped, and too tired to hike it back to my home." He turned with a smile and stared at the closed glittering golden tinted doors of the chamber rooms inside the Cee Building. "We sleep here."

I gasped and turned to see the closed glittering golden tinted doors of the Cee chamber suite with a worried brow. "Here? No, no, not right, I don't wanna sleep with the dead."

"Then, you can sleep with me. I actually feel dead tired," he softly chuckled.

I gasped. "No, no, not right, I can't..."

"There are lots of rooms. You get your room. I get my private room."

He turned with a smile and dragged Igala toward the closed glittering golden tinted doors that hid the suites of chamber rooms. "And when you can't sleep, you come and crawl into bed with me. Then I'll read you my favorite bedtime story with a happy ending for all."

I shook my curls with a sour frown and moved toward the closed doors. "No, not happening."

"This is Zulu Time. Something always happens." He chuckled.

The golden doors parted and opened in silence.

02:02 am (early morning)

Cee chamber suite rooms

Interior setting

They entered through the archway and moved down the hallway.

I veered toward the first room on the left. That particular sleeping chamber room had serviced as my personal second bedroom through three Zulu Times, so it must be lucky.

Dfee held her hand and veered with Igala toward the bedroom with a grin and a chuckle.

I slammed the door with a palm and entered through the archway.

Dfee continued to hold her hand and followed behind her back spine through the archway of the private bedroom.

I released my hand and spun around with a sneer. "Go and find your own room, Dfee!"

He chuckled. "I like this room. I like the color of black."

"Find your own room, now! I'm tired and hungry. Go and find me some food, now!"

He frowned. "If I find you some food, can we eat on top of your bed?"

"Yeah, find me some food. Then we can eat on my bed."

"Yeehaw!" He back stepped from her with a smile and reached around, pressing a finger into the closed door. The door cracked opened. Dfee stood in the archway with a wink at his girl.

I stood in front of the bed with a yawn and a tone of bad breath, waving a hand with a yawn for a second time without covering my mouth.

He back stepped from the archway with a smile and a wink to his girl. The door closed. Dfee spun around with a chuckle and a smile, moving toward the marble island in the center of the hallway, slamming a body into the hard granite with a grunt. He dropped down and opened the door with a chuckle.

At 01:15 am, Dfee had finished the examination of the island cabinet and all the hidden contents, standing upright and moved down toward the bathroom for his bodily functions. He didn't like to pee in the wildwoods, only if necessary.

Inside the bathroom, standing in front of a row dirty wash sinks and the half mirror, he slammed the new toothbrush onto the counter with a smile, looking at the other items. "Toothbrush. Toothpaste. Mouthwash. Comb. Peppermint candy. Everything a soon-to-be-dead person needs before the Zulu Time show." He reached over and grabbed the candy unwrapping it and popped the sweetness into the mouth, looking down with a sour frown at the clean trash basket. He dropped the wrapping over the dirty floor with a frown. "Except for some freaking food, I guess the angels must feed you in heaven when you arrive as a dead man." He had eaten all the food items inside the storage cabinet that was underneath the granite island in front the entrance doors, since he was testing all the food items in case of poisoning. He didn't want his girl to get sick or dead before they were married. Dfee found that he was not poisoned but hungry as his stomach continued to growl.

He back stepped with a sour frown from the sinks and the mirror, admiring a dirty and bloody shirt, a pair of shredded, faded dirty and blood stained blue jeans, and a pair of dirty cowboy boots, spinning around to face the archway and stomped down the marble, stopping and stood in front of her bedroom door with a smile. He knocked on the door with a nervous sigh, hearing no movement inside the room. He knocked for a second time and exhaled with a huff of worry and a whisper. "She's tired. I'll tired and hungry, too. I'll let her sleep while I round up us some food." He nodded with a grin and snapped the fingers. "Yeah, the dance hall always has fruit trays and sweet cupcakes. Yummy, yeah, man-made sugar plus natural sugar from my girly sugar taste buds," he back stepped and spun around to face the glittering golden tinted closed doors with a chuckle and a smile, strutting toward the exit archway.

He stomped down the middle of the invisible seam of the two doors.

The twin doors parted and opened.

At 02:30 am, Dfee slowly strutted over the white marble floor between the tombs of dead people inside the dead walls and turned to the side, moving down the hallway and hit the wooden flooring that led into the dance hall, hearing the noise.

A Regulator moved from the Regulator office within the Cee building toward the dance hall, too.

He whispered for his eardrums with panic. "Shit." Dfee stopped and scanned the hallway. The door was open. He ran ahead into the dark passage without noise or good lighting and skidded to a halt with a whisper. "This is the hallway into the Zulu Time arena. Geez! This is a bad sign or sigh or shit." He ran through the semi-darkness of the hallway and moved passes the rows of glass cages, exiting through a second open archway and stopped. He was inside the wooden floor of the Vee building hallway, whispering with panic, "Geez, another worse sign or sigh or shit."

Dfee could not back track into the Cee Building, without being seen or heard or suspicious. And he didn't want the Regulator to accidentally discover Igala on top of the bed mattress inside one of the sleeping units in the Cee Building.

He turned to the side and moved toward the silver tinted entrance doors that held the suites of room inside the Vee Building for a temporary hiding spot.

A new Regulator moved ahead, coming from the Regulator office of the Vee Building and shouted at the back spine on Dfee. "Excuse me, sir!"

He whispered with panic. "Shit." Dfee halted with a gasp and swung around with a fake smile and a nod in silence to see the golden tinted Regulator.

The Regulator advanced forward and stopped, standing in front of Dfee without a smile or a facial emotion. "Are you invited to Zulu Time?"

Dfee shook his blonde colored curls with a stern face, "No, man."

The Regulator droned in tenor timber and stared at Dfee. "Why are you inside the Vee Building, sir?"

"Well, dude, the doors were open and not locked." Dfee turned and smiled at the pink marble wall and back to the Regulator, patting the cold wall with a nod. "I was visiting my friend. He's dead in here, somewhere."

The Regulator droned in tenor timber without a smile, "A noble gesture. Was your friend a victim or a criminal?"

Dfee pointed at the entrance double doors and stared at the Regulator with a smile. "Victim, that's why I came through the doors of the Vee Building for the victim. He was a victim. He died a victim. But I'm not a victim, I am..."

"What is the name of your friend?"

Dfee frowned. "He was called Zug."

"Zug, is that the first or last name?"

Dfee nodded. "Zug is his first name."

The Regulator turned without a smile and pointed to each wall of pink granite. "The walls are alphabetized by first name. Your friend will be located on the opposite end."

He smiled with a nod. "Thanks, yeah. Thanks for your wise advice." The Regulator dropped both arms down to the side and stared at Dfee in silence. Dfee cleared a throat with nervousness, wondering if the Regulator recognized his scruffy handsome face from the Bowl competition. "Do you have some more wise advice for me, sir or ma'am?"

"Where are your ornaments for the tomb, such like, a flower?"

Dfee chuckled with a wink. "Zug don't like flowers. Flowers are for girls, not Zug. He was a man. He died like a man."

The Regulator nodded without smiling and droned in tenor timber, "Very good, sir." It back stepped and swung around, moving back down toward the dance hall for the new task.

Dfee turned and slid a nose bridge into the wall with a grunt like he was searching for the name and listened.

The heavy footpads of the single Regulator vanished deeply further down the wooden floor, moving toward the dance hall. The group of Regulators on the night shift was preparing for the new set of Zulu Time occupants, tomorrow afternoon.

Dfee leaned over and jerked off each boot, cuddling the dirty foot ware into a chest and back stepped and spun around, running over the cold pink marble floor with a worried brow and a worried heart of a whisper. "Igala, I don't want the robots to find her first." He slid across the floor on a pair of soft socks. He halted and spun around to see the open archway, running back into the open archway of the Zulu Time hallway, where a row of glass cages stood empty with a black colored wall of glass that contained all the invited Zulu Time occupants like a set of exhibition animals.

At 02:40 am, Dfee ran through the opposite archway and emerged back into the Cee hallway, dashing down the wooden floor and turned to wall corner, running by the wall of white granite and the dead bodies toward the glittering golden tinted closed doors of the Cee Building suites. He could hear a set of faint voices behind a back spine.

The faint voices were coming out from the dance hall entranceway into the Cee Building side to clean the Cee Building suites next.

At 02:45 am (early evening), Dfee slammed into the partially opened double doors through her private suite, sliding between the small crack with a grunt of pain, dashing over the smooth granite, passing the marble island and turned, slamming a hand into the closed door of Igala. He dashed and slid onto the bed mattress with a soft curse and a worried brow. "Shit."

His body leaped into the air and then covered her body in wiggles and grunts. He slammed a hand over her mouth with a worried brow and a whisper into her face. "Shush! The robots are coming." Dfee pulled over and dragged her body from the bed with some of the bedding, dropping down over the floor.

I wore a thin black colored bed linen over a body, dropping down into the floor with a worried brow and a gasp, moving with Dfee. I slithered underneath the bed mattress and heard the faint voices of the Regulators inside the unoccupied suites of the Cee Building. I crawled toward the side wall and twisted around, slithering a body into the middle space of the king-sized bed mattress and stopped, resting beside Dfee and watched the edge of the closed door. I held the collect bar between the bed linen sheets with nervousness.

Dfee was winded and panting from the swift run, resting beside Igala, watching with a worried heart the lower edge of the closed door.

The bedroom chamber door of Igala parted and opened.

A pair of golden tinted boot toes moved into the room and stopped. The voice of alto timber echoed through the room from one of the Regulators. "The last Cee team made a mess inside their selected sleeping rooms and both the bathrooms. I am glad that batch of bitches are dead." It stomped further into the room, kicking one of the girly sandals out the door. "They even left their personal possessions behind which is against the Zulu Time rule."

"My..." I gasped with a whisper.

Dfee leaned over and covered her mouth, realizing that Igala was almost naked underneath the bed sheet next to his body with a grin and a snigger, pulling her tight into a chest. She reached over and kicked his boot shin with a naked foot with a sneer.

The Regulator turned and kicked the torn dress and the other girly sandal out from the bed chamber and into the hallway with a sneer. "Start cleaning up the girly bathroom. I will get the male bathroom. Don't bother to change the bedding on top of the mattress, just make each bedcover into a pretty presentable shape. There is a horde of new thirteen victims coming today. Is the figure thirteen an unlucky math number? My bet is that they do not return back here to celebrate either. So, we can clean everything much better, tomorrow."

"Yes sir." The second pair of golden tinted boot toes back stepped from the room and turned, moving down the hallway with a set of heavy thuds, starting the new task of the early morning.

I and Dfee continued to snuggle underneath the bed mattress and watched with a worried brow and listened with a worried heart until I heard the snorting with a soft giggle.

Dfee had fallen asleep beside her rib cage from exhaustion and excitement.

I exhaled with a puff of relief that he was here to protect me while thinking about Ucal. The collect bar stabbed my leg. I was reminded that I needed to carry and hide it from the Regulators before giving it to my mom. I leaned over and tilted a sleepy Dfee up onto his rib cage, slipping my collector bar down into the deep pocket of his blue jeans with a gasp. I jerked out the object and lifted it toward my face. It was another collector bar that belonged to Dfee. I giggled with the revelation. He used his personal collector bar and his personal coin to bribe the row of Regulators at each steel gates, entering the new Society City to see Igala with love.

I reached down and replaced his collector bar back into the same pocket and crawled over Dfee and then placed my collector bar inside the opposite side pocket of his blue jeans for safekeeping until I could give it to my mom. I back crawled and rested on top of the thin bedcovers with a yawn and a sour breath, closing my eyelashes, falling down into a deep sleep of exhaustion, too.

07:07 am (early morning)

Cee room

Private bed chamber with Igala and Dfee

Underneath the bed mattress setting

Igala and Dfee continued to snuggle and rest underneath the bed mattress together, sleeping from both exhaustion and worry. Each Regulator had finish cleaning each room and left the suite.

The air waves echoed in silence.

Dfee awoke from the stillness of the air with mouth drool, reaching up and wiped off the mess. He had fallen asleep beside Igala underneath the bed for hours, dreaming of her, escaping from Society City Four. He slowly crawled forward over the clean and shiny floor and as, his nostrils smelled the light scent of pine cones over the clean tiles. His eyeballs saw the closed door of the room. His eardrums heard silence within the suites. He slowly scooted backward with a grin and stopped, turning with a grin to see her nose profile.

Igala was asleep and rested on the side of her face with a slight twinkle of mouth spat, too.

He chuckled, "Awe, so precious! See? We mouth drool on the same side," he reached over and gently shook her arm with a whisper into her face. "Wake up, beauty! The coast is clear. However, we aren't living on the sea water. So the door is closed. We can leave, now. We can leave and go and get married, Igala." He gently touched her face with a warm finger and a smile.

I awoke from the faint voice and the warm touch, lifting up a wet mouth of drool to see Dfee and gasped in shock. Then, I smiled with love at Dfee, forgetting that I had fallen asleep, after escaping from the Bowl and the Regulators of Society City Four.

Dfee crawled forward from underneath the bed mattress first and stood upright, moving to the closed door. He reached out and touched the handle, cracking the door open, using one eyeball to see the hallway.

I crawled forward out from underneath the bed mattress with a grunt and stood upright, wrapping the thin black colored bed linen over my nakedness with a red face of embarrassment with a whisper of worry, "Now, what? I can't walk outside or around the cold suites of dead people in here looking like this."

Dfee spun around with a chuckle and shook his curls with a grin to see Igala, moving forward and stopped in front of her frown, without touching Igala with a pair of his hands. "I like you like this. There is plenty of time to waste while we wait..."

"Dfee, I am serious."

"I'm serious, too." He winked with a chuckle.

"I'm really serious, too."

He smiled. "Okay. I have a plan, since you are panty-less, I mean, plan-less. We wait for the Cee team and then infiltrate the floatie clothing rake. The robots always bring the floating wardrobe rake before the Zulu Time dance. Then we get dressed into some new and fresh clothing and invade the Zulu Time Ball."

"I like." I smirked with a nod. "But I will modify your sentence structure. We will dress and then we will leave the Zulu Time ball for...."

"I don't own a limo, beauty. That is how all the folks get here and into the Zulu Time Building and around the streets and away from the Zulu Time Building. The robots provide the slick transportation. I can't take on a robot. Well, I can, if I need to. So we get dressed up for the fancy hoe-down one final time and find our mutual schooler friend Ucal."

I frowned. "Ucal is dead."

"Ucal is alive. We didn't find his name on the wall of dead bodies. He will pea stain inside his new re-designer blue jeans upon seeing our smiling faces and then get him to drive us to each other houses for food and a hot bath. My body itches for you...."

I frowned with a nod. "I hope that Ucal still lives..."

"I promise that Ucal still lives." He smiled with a nod. "We didn't find his name on the wall of white or pink. And I promise that you that..."

"We are really done with Zulu Time."

Dfee leaned over and kissed her naked shoulder, pulling back with a wink and a grin, "I promise, beauty. We're finally done with Zulu Time and Society City Four. My new re-gen job waits with readiness for me and you. We kiss each parent with a goodbye kiss on each cheekbone and leave immediately tonight. We get married in the morning, the start of our new lives."

"I like."

Then, they kissed.

At 07:30 am, in the front of the Cee hallway, the set of glittering golden tinted twin doors parted. The new members of the Cee team stumbled inside and around the marble, making loud noises of laughter and grunts.

Inside the closed door of the bedroom of Dfee and Igala, they talked, laughed, and kissed again on top of the bed.

I parted from his warm lips with a gasp and slid off the bed mattress with a worried brow, dropping down onto the floor in a set of clean bed sheets and crawled forward toward the wall and spun around, stopping and hiding underneath the bed mattress with the door open for a second time. I wore a set of brown colored raccoon eyeballs and waited for the clothing rack to appear, dressing in something beside a bed linen sheet, hearing the loud set of new voices inside the hallway.

He slid off the bed with a chuckle and moved ahead, slamming a hand into the door with his new brilliant plan. The door opened. "Howdy, ya'll!" Dfee shouted and moved ahead with a smile from one of the other sleeping suites with Igala, waving an arm, wearing the raccoon eyeball mask that covered a real face.

One of the adult males of the new Vee team spun around with a puzzled brow to see Dfee. "Who are you?"

"Your mama's fourth cousin, thrice removed." Dfee stopped and stood in front of the stranger male, extending a hand like a good gentleman with a smile and a nod.

The male frowned. "My mama, did she sent you to be with me inside Zulu Time, boy?"

Dfee lifted and held up a stolen iron rod from the bed headboard in the air with a smile and a nod. "Your mama is a good soul. She sent me here to you and armed, sir."

The male smiled with a nod, extending a handshake. "Welcome, cousin...?"

"Cousin Slick, it is a pleasure nice to meet all of my long lost family members." Dfee shook each hand with a chuckle and a nod, enjoying the fun.

The twin doors parted. A set of two floating clothing racks emerged through the archway.

The new members of the Cee team back stepped with a set of awe at the floating rack and the team of two golden Regulators.

The two floating clothing racks stopped and settled down onto the floor on each side of the wall. Then the two Regulators spun around and left the entrance of the Cee suits.

The twin doors closed.

The adult female of the new Cee team pointed at each clothing rack with a smile. "The first thing we all need to do is dress for the dance with food that's what the Zulu Time instructions say. Girls, pick a pretty dress. Boys, pick a prissy jacket. Then we go and do a hoe-down with the rest of the Society people, tonight." The new members of the Cee team dashed forward and rummaged through the clothing, selecting different gowns and suit jackets.

Dfee stood beside the marble island with a grin and waited for each Cee team member to leave the clothing racks. Each new member of the Cee team spun around and dashed into a separate room with armful of clothing. He moved forward toward the men's clothing rack and fling out an arm, grabbing the first sporting jacket on the rack, spinning to the side, advancing toward the clothing rack for the ladies.

His eyeballs swiftly scanned each gown and stopped on the sexiest one inside the clothing rack. He stopped and stood in front of the clothing rack of the girls, reaching out with a chuckle and selected the bright red colored gown with a grin, holding in the air with a nod, "Yeah, this one! I like shopping for my girl."

He back stepped and spun around, draping the gown with the sissy sports jacket over his arm with a smile, dashing toward the shared bedroom that held a naked Igala with a chuckle. "Then, we get ready to part-ee with food and dance for the night before Ucal takes us home." He slammed the closed metal on the door.

The bedroom door of Igala parted and then opened.

Dfee entered the private bedroom suite, stopped, and stood with a laugh in front of the bed mattress.

Underneath the bed mattress, I could see his set of dirty and unpolished boot toes and crawled ahead over the floor with a smile, slowly standing upright on top of the floor. I adjusted the loose bed linen around my naked body with a gasp. "That dress..."

"... is very nice!" He nodded with a smile at the dress. "I got good taste for a guy."

I examined the evening dress with a gasp. "It is missing two sleeves, a collar, and an entire back panel. It is strapless..."

"Strip for me! That's very nice, too." He winked with a chuckle at her.

I reached out with a sour frown and snatched the dress in the air, drawing it closer, examining the strapless and sleeveless gown with fury, "Dfee!"

He slipped on the oversized lavender colored sporting jacket over the grass and bloody stained white dirty T-shirt with a smile and a chuckle. "That's me!" Dfee was dressed in an extra-large sporting jacket, buttoning the front to hide the red blood stains and the green grass stains, readying for the dance, looking forward to the food with a growling stomach.

I stared down at the evening dress with a puff of annoyance. "This is not a dress. It is in the color of bright red. I don't want to be seen by the Regulators."

"You wear a set of raccoon-eyeballs. No one will see you, only the raccoon eyeballs."

I exhaled with a puff of worry. "Everyone will see me in bright fiery red colors. Turn around and face the door. Close your eyes, too. I need to change." Dfee slowly turned and faced the door with a smile and a snigger. I stood in place with a sneer. "Close your eyeballs, Dfee. Do not move, either." He stood in place at the metal door without touching it with a set of sniggers and a wicked smile. I turned with a puff of annoyance and moved around the other side of the bed mattress, stopping and squatted down over the floor out of his eye sight, dropping the waddled up bed linens from my body. I quickly wiggled into the long dress which wasn't hard, since there wasn't a set of sleeves or a collar. I stood upright and faced the wall, straightening out the dress at the waist and the hemline before tripping and passing out over the floor.

He had spun around when she dropped down behind the bed mattress with a sad face and sniggered with a smile at the back of the dress, "Ah, naw! You cheated me."

I swung around with a sneer and shifted the bodice over my body. "Boy, you cheated. I told you to face the metal door."

He frowned. "It was lonely and boring. I enjoyed watching the wall." He smiled.

I turned and waddled sideways from the wall and the bed mattress with a sigh of annoyance. "All right. I'm dressed. Where do we find Ucal here inside the Cee Building?"

"He will be inside the dance hall."

I gasped. "We can't go and dance inside the dance hall. All the Regulators are inside the dance hall."

"We are in disguise as an ugly raccoon with our painted eyeballs. We have to find Ucal there first. Or we are stuck in here with the losers of the Cee team."

I frowned. "How do you know that they are losers?"

I smiled. "The Cee teams always lose in Zulu Time."

"That's not a true statement."

He smiled. "It is tonight. I'm voting for the Vee team."

"You lie. You don't have your com-d. Since I placed it on the horse. Then the poor horse got shot by the mean Regulators in front of the ancient railroad boxcar."

"You're smart, beauty." He leaned over and kissed he lips, pulling back with a wink. "Let's go and find Ucal. I wanna go home and start our honeymoon."

I shoved him with a smile from my dress with a giggle. "We get married and then start the honeymoon, dearest."

"Yeehaw," He gasped. "Listen! The Regulators are here." He spun around and tapped the metal door. The door slowly cracked open. He leaned a nose bridge through the crack to see the hallway.

The other members of the new Cee team were moving in a set of groups, exiting from the Cee suites, following behind a row of Regulators. He exhaled with worry. "Okay. The hallway is cleared of the strangers. We slowly walk behind the group of strangers and enter the dance hall. Then we find Ucal." He slammed open the door and extended a hand to her.

I grabbed his hand and cuddled into his side, gathering the long evening gown into the other hand, swiftly moving ahead and through the archway of the Cee suites. I looked back over a collar bone to see the long cold hallway inside the Cee chamber suites of dead bodies inside the walls with a smile. "Bye-bye. Cee ya never!" I swung a face to see the back spines of each stranger on the new Cee team with a sad face. Someone was going to die inside Zulu Time, tonight.

The party turned the wall corner and moved down the wooden floor, turning again and entered through the open archway of the dance floor.

08:08 am (early morning)

Zulu Time Ball banquet location

Dance hall setting

Dfee slowly escorted Igala over the active dance floor with a smirk and waltzed toward the food table on the side wall during the slow classical music with piano and harp musical notes. The dance floor was almost empty with a set of dancers. Other people stood against the wall or sit down on top of a piece of furniture, eating or whispering.

I gasped. "The dance hall is almost empty. We need to find Ucal, right now."

"I need to find some food before I faint. Then the Regulators will find Dfee. That's me." He advanced to the side wall with rows of steaming food trays with a smile and a growling stomach and stopped, standing in front of the empty plates.

I stopped at the first table and stood beside Dfee with a worried brow, looking back over a naked collar bone at the long wall of Regulators. "We're supposed to dance. Where are the rows of Regulators? The side wall is almost empty. There are only about six or seven of them."

"Who cares? My brain and my stomach only care only about food." He reached out and grabbed an empty plate with a smile, eyeing all the steaming food trays. "We can mingle as a pair of non-dancers at the food tables and stand side by side and talk. Grab a plate before the Regulator gets suspicious."

I swung a worried brow to see the side wall that held the food tables, reaching down and grabbed an empty plate. My stomach could not handle food. But I continued to fake as an invited guest of the Zulu Time Ball, filling a plate of food like a pretend starving person.

Dfee shuffled down the row of food trays and stopped, slowly spinning around to face a new wall, moving ahead and stopped on the long wall, slowly swinging around and leaned against the beige paint. He dived into the food and ate, chewing with a smile. His stomach continued to growl.

I filled an empty plate with a mountain of food like I was starving and stopped at the last of the food tables, slowly turning around with the platter and followed behind the back spine on Dfee, stopping and swinging around, leaning against the empty spot on the wall with him, without furniture and other people. I lifted the fork and picked at the food with worry and nervousness, hearing the classical musical song and leaned over with a whisper. "I don't see him. Is he really alive? Ucal is not located on the northern or western walls of long sofas, ugly set of raccoon eyeballs, and eating people."

He swallowed with a smile and a whisper. "He's parked between a set of two Regulators on the entrance wall." He ate and chewed the food with a grin, turning to scan the dancers and the rest of the people.

I slowly turned with a worried brow and faced the eastern wall, looking for Ucal. "We should wait until the end of the dance ball."

He swallowed the food with a grin. "No. We're the invited dance guest, not the criminal or the victim. We ain't supposed to be dancing for more than five minutes with a strange partner and then give the dance up for the next dancer. Except I don't wanna do that, I want us to leave in a few minutes. Ucal can depart anytime he wants. So we just happen to follow his back spine out the same archway and move toward one of the awaiting limousines."

I lifted the fork and picked at the food like I was eating with a fake smile of non-happiness. "I like."

He finished eating all the food with a rush and burped out loud with a smile, patting the chest with a chuckle. "There, I'm full of food. Let's dance." He reached over and placed his used plate on top of the tall table that held an assortment of dirty dishes that the Regulators must clean for the next evening of Zulu Time. He leaned over and gently grabbed the plate from Igala with a frown. "You didn't eat the good food."

I wring both gloves hands of bright red hues with a worried brow and a worried heart, staring at the back spine and the pair of black and aqua boots of Ucal. "I'm too nervous. I wanna leave from here, right now."

He reached over and placed her plate of food on top of his dirty dish with a smile, turning with a chuckle and cuddled her, back stepping from the wall, heading backward onto the empty dance floor with a yawn. "I'm ready for a nap. We communicate with Ucal and then get outta here. I'm leading us that way, just dance elegantly like always." Dfee hugged her and slowly swayed side to side with her, moving toward the wall of Regulators with Ucal.

I turned and faced the nose profile of Ucal. He continued to whisper into the face of the short Regulator, not paying attention to the girly winks. I continued to wink at the side of his nose profile of Ucal, exhaling with a puff of annoyance and a whisper into Dfee. "Ucal must be brain-dead from falling off that dang horse."

"I'm swinging you around again. I'll try to make contact with the brain-dead idiot." Dfee turned and faced the back spine on Ucal, releasing a bird whistle over the loud rock and roll music of guitars and drums. But the loud music of the song continued to drown out the soft bird sound. Dfee stopped the song with a sour frown. "Ucal isn't even looking at me or you or a girl. He's turned to the dark side of the wall," chuckling.

"Stop it, Dfee! Dance us closer. Once he sees me, he will turn back to see my smile." I giggled.

"I am twirling you around, again." Dfee slowly whirled her around and around while they danced toward the nose profile of Ucal. Then Dfee stopped the dance and stood with Igala. Both of them started winking and smiling at the nose profile of Ucal.

Ucal shifted side to side and turned with a sour frown to see Igala and Dfee with the silly winks.

Dfee swirled Igala around with a laugh and moved away from the wall of Regulators and his childhood friend Ucal with a chuckle.

Ucal moved ahead from the wall of Regulators and stopped, standing next to the nose profile of Dfee with a fake smile. "May I have this dance?"

Dfee swayed side to side with a smile at Igala. "No."

Ucal smiled at the nose profile of Dfee like he was talking to the male dancer. "Good to see both of ya'll in here. Now, go and act like an ugly wallflower and lean against the wall alone, bro. Get around plate of food and watch us dance. Then, come back after a few minutes to be her dance partner, again. Then we all will leave from the Zulu Time Ball."

I exhaled. "Leave, now."

Ucal stared at the nose profile of Dfee, because he wasn't supposed to know the name of female dancer. "No. Go and get some food, now, Dfee. We will all leave at the end of the song, since we don't wanna raise some golden tinted eyebrows. Stay cool, bro!" Ucal gently shoved Dfee away from Igala and moved to stand in front of her with a smile, reaching down and grabbed her waist. "Are you hurt or injured? I can't tell in that dress, but I like your dress, gorgeous." He swiftly swayed side to side and moved away from the wall of Regulators toward the opposite side of the dance floor.

Dfee side stepped with a chin bow like a good dancer and turned to face the food table, advancing to the wall with a sneer of jealousy with his girl and his buddy.

I faked a smile with a worried heart. "We are moving away from Dfee."

He chuckled. "Dfee can take care of his selfie for a few seconds."

"We're moving away from the only set of exit doors."

"We need to get outta ear range of the Regulators."

I exhaled. "No, we escaped without major injury. Dfee was..."

Ucal exhaled. "Look, Igala! I need to tell you something..."

"I heard the multiple rounds of gun shots. I thought that you died inside the Bowl during Zulu Time." I turned and stared at the back spine on Dfee with worry. He grabbed a new plate and filled it with more food, moving down the food table and stopped, spinning around and moved to an empty spot on the wall, staring at Ucal and Igala. He lifted the fork of food and ate, feeling worry and jealous, but his stomach didn't care.

On the dance floor, Ucal smirked at Igala. "I almost did. At the end of the thirty-minute deadline..."

"Thirty minutes to death! I hate Zulu Time."

"I do, too. At the end of the thirty-minute deadline, a row of Regulators entered through the steel gates and killed Kallidin and her ugly non-cousins. I can't believe you got passed all the protesters.

I frowned. "What protesters?"

"There have been a set of multiple gangs of yelling and screaming protesters in front of all the buildings on the Zulu Time campus all morning long, since sunrise." He gasped. "How did you and Dfee get inside the Cee building and passed the protesters?"

I frowned. "Why are there protesters? What are they protesting?"

"The protesters bust through the doors with an individual hand gun inside the Bowl and killed some of the Regulators, before the Regulators turned and killed them all dead."

I gasped. "Citizens as protesters entered Zulu Time with guns, what for? How come?"

He exhaled. "Look, Igala! We need to talk. I need to tell you something. I wanna ask you something important."

I frowned. "Ask me, what?"

He turned and stared at the wall of Regulators. "Not, here! When the song ends, I'll take you back home. So we can ride and talk in the limo."

I smiled with a nod. "We can all ride and talk inside the limousine with Dfee. I need to tell you something, too."

He turned and gasped at her smile. "What do you need to tell me, Igala?"

"Inside the limo," I smiled.

On the far wall, the young female in the long tight fitting sapphire blue gown sashayed over and stood next to the nose profile of Dfee, reaching out and tapped his collar bone with a smile and a set of raccoon eyeballs. "Can a single girl ask you for a dance, sir?"

Dfee turned with a sneer to see the short teenage girl with annoyance, since he was waiting the hand signal of Ucal. He would dance with the girl for a few seconds. "Well, shore...b...babe." He held the platter of food.

On the entrance wall, each door bust opened. A gang of street people entered from each side door with a set of screams and yells, running into the middle of the dance floor, scattering the elegant dancers. A group of loose Regulators dashed behind and corralled all the protesters into a huddle, shoving the people on a set of various body parts with force, shuffling all the yelling protesters back through the open archway and into the hallway.

The entrance doors closed and shut.

The protesters continued to shout inside the hallway and moved toward the exit doors of the Vee Building.

Dfee turned and gasped at the protesters and the closed doors. "What is that?"

She smiled. "O protesters. They have been spoiling the fun all day and night around here."

He stared at the closed door with a puzzled brow. "Why are they here? What are they protesting?"

"Stuff," she reached out and grabbed the hand with a gasp, hanging into the limb with a smile. "Where are your gloves, sir?"

Dfee looked down with a stern face at her blue tinted gloved hand and both his naked hands, forgetting to retrieve a pair of gloves inside the Cee suits from the rack of male clothing, since he was planning to dance only with Igala while searching for Ucal. Then they would all escape the Zulu Time Ball. He turned with a smile to see her frown. "I'm a clumsy redneck that spilled my beverage over the left hand. So I ditched them. The other young lady didn't like the wetness."

She held his naked hand and looked down with a giggle, examining his trousers with a smirk. "Your blue jeans are dirty with a set of visual green colored grass stains and circular burnt holes like a fire, redneck. Didn't your mama teach you to change your clothing after barbequing the dead pig, boy?"

"Mom tried and still tries." He smiled down at her hair roots.

She held his hand and looked up with a wink and a smile to the male. "I don't think the bright lavender color compliments your gorgeous blonde locks, Dfee."

He parted his lips. "What?"

She released his naked hand and back stepped with a smile, jabbing a manicured finger at him with a yell, "Dfee, the criminal from Zulu Time is here. He's over here."

Dfee side stepped with a gasp from the young girl with a whisper and turned with a worried brow to see the movement. "Shit." A team of Regulators dashed ahead from the wall and stopped, surrounding Dfee.

The tallest Regulator leaned down and bad breathed into the hair roots of Dfee. "You are invited to Zulu Time, sir."

On the dance floor, Ucal pulled Igala into his chest with a worried brow and a gasp, dancing backward, slamming his legs into the long sofa without people, sitting down inside the furniture. Igala dropped down and landed inside his lap with a gasp and a worried heart. He leaned over and covered her face with sweet mint breath and a whisper. "Don't move."

I sob with tears of worry and a whisper, "Dfee?"

Ucal whispered. "I have a plan. Don't worry! But you have to stay hidden for a few more seconds. The Regulators are looking for you, too, gorgeous."

I sobbed with more tears of worry. "Why, Ucal? Why is this happening in here, now? We easily blended into the crowd of dancers with the painted raccoon eyes...

He frowned. "Shush! Act surprised, not sad. Don't give us away."

"Okay." I moaned with a fake grin.

The Regulators turned and escorted Dfee toward the open archway, disappearing into the dark hallway.

The entrance door remained open.

The Zulu Time hostesses, Jamie and Jackie entered through the same doorway without twirling in a series of completed circles and stopped in front of the food tables.

Each one was dressed in an ankle-length evening gown and wore a sour frown with a set of black bones and skulls facial designs, saying in unison. "The ball has ended. Leave now! Everyone, leave!"

They turned in unison with a sour frown and dashed through the open archway, disappearing from the Zulu Time dance hall and into the hallway.

Ucal stood upright from the sofa and set Igala next to him with a smile. "That's it. We can go..."

I gasped with worry, "Dfee?"

Ucal moved ahead and cuddled Igala with a smile, heading toward one of the two open archways with the rest of the confused dancers. "I know. I need to go and see my mom. She's standing at the wall. She'll help me get you outta of here."

I gasped with more worry. "Dfee?"

"Yeah, I'll take care of Dfee, too. I can't kiss you here, but I will later, after we're far away from here. I need to tell you something." He moved ahead and released Igala. "My mom is motioning to me. Move out the door and toward one of the parked limousines. Stand around and looked pretty! I'll be there, soonest."

He moved ahead with a smile and stopped with a gasp. Igala stood in the middle of the dance floor and stared at the back spine on Ucal.

One of the Regulators moved and advanced from the wall of Regulators, coming toward Igala.

Ucal spun around and rushed ahead to Igala with a worried brow, slowly passing her with a whisper near her eardrum. "Solo. Solo. Solo. Said, solo..." He continued to march ahead with a worried brow and stopped, standing in front the long sofa, leaning down over the cushion, seeing the upside back spine on Igala. Acting like, he had forgotten something on the sofa.

I gasped at the tart vocal whisper from Ucal and stared with a worried brow at the approaching row of Regulator.

The row of Regulators stopped and stood in front of Igala and Oltole without a smile or an emotion. The center Regulators droned. "Please, follow me back to the Cee chamber suites!"

The row of Regulators spun around and moved ahead toward the open archway.

I slowly moved ahead and stared at the back spine on four Regulators with a set of parted lips and a whisper for my eardrums only. "What is going on here?" I strolled through the open archway and moved down the wooden floor with a stern face. My life sucked. I was visiting Zulu Time for the fourth time which was uncommonly unnatural.

I knew my crime. I was a criminal for leaving the Bowl arena during Zulu Time. I remembered on my first day of Hall, where I was learning a new re-gen job that an escaped person from Zulu Time was an automatic criminal. Now, I had been captured like my love Dfee.

Dfee was a criminal, too. The Regulators calmed hauled Dfee away from Igala and the dance hall without blood. Dfee didn't even fight with them for freedom.

I turned the wall corner and moved down the familiar white colored marble with a set of embedded tiny golden specks. The hallway housed the tombs of the dead inside the cold hallway. I felt sad and lonely, not ready to die. I would be immediately placed on the wall of the criminals and dressed in the tan and red colored tape inside the Zulu Time room without screaming or fighting. I wondered if death hurt. Then I would be shot by the array of hand guns from a row of faceless and emotionless Regulators.

I wondered if the mom of Ucal would be there on the Zulu Time line.

The row of four Regulators stopped and turned, back stepping from the entrance doors of the Cee chamber suites, slamming into the cold wall of dead people and appeared like a set of angels with a pair of wing as they stood against the wall within the fire of the urns of light.

The glittering golden tinted twin doors parted and then opened back into the Cee chamber rooms of death.

Present day and place and time

287th day (continued)

Society City Four

Warm temperatures with bright sunlight

09:09 am

Cee Building

Chamber suite rooms

I entered with a stern face into the cold suites of the Cee Building that housed ancient dead people that didn't decay and then stopped, standing near the marble island and felt sad, angry, mad, unhappy, and scared to death of dying.

A cupped hand reached out and grabbed the collar bone of Igala. Igala gasped and heard in her eardrum. "Where have you been all this time, Igala?" Her grandmother Oltole stood next to the nose profile of her granddaughter Igala.

I turned and gasped into the face of my grandmother. "What are you doing here at the Zulu Time Ball, Granny?"

The dad of Igala marched into the hallway from a separate room with a smile and patted his stomach with a laugh, stopping and stood around the familiar island of granite. "I don't know why we are all here, again. But I enjoy the food. Your mom enjoyed the dancing. The kids enjoyed jumping up and down over the firm bed mattresses again. The Regulators showed up at our house within the hour and invited us to go for a ride inside their limousine again, coming back to Zulu Time. I think that we're the repeating guest stars."

I turned and gasped to see one of the closed doors. "How long have you been here? Where are the...?"

"Igala, Igala?" The sister of Igala, Laddie dashed from the hand of Henoana and slammed into the long dress of Igala with a giggle, back stepping and touched the silk gown of her sister. "Igala, we all saw you on top of that horsey. Then the horsey jumped up and hurt the wall. Did you get hurt like the horsey?"

I looked down with a confused brow and patted the hair band of purple gems on Laddie with a smile. "Laddie, it was a false wall that was made of soft paper. It was really a great big drawing that covered the hidden set of lush woodlands. I didn't get hurt."

The mom of Henoana tripped over the elegantly ankle-length evening gown of purple with a pair of new re-designer heels and a sour frown and stopped, standing in place with a puff, reaching down and lifted up the dress hemline into a ball with a smile. She moved ahead with a smile. "Children, we need change and dress into your newly selected re-designer clothing. We are not wearing one pre-offered trash wardrobe item from the common racks of clothing for our swift visitation into Zulu Time." She stopped and stood next to Igala. "The fans love us."

I turned and gasped at my mom, "Mom?"

The brother of Igala, Segue raced down the hallway and slammed into the marble island for fun without injury and with a grin. "We saw you and the horse jump through the wall. Where did you go, Igala?"

I turned and stared with a gasp at my brother. "I went into the woodlands, Segue."

Henoana lifted both arm into the air with a sneer. "Enough, chat-chat!" She dropped both arms down and slapped the new re-designer dress with a smile and a nod, "Everyone, go back into your selected private royal room! I have acted like one of the worker droids and laid out your clothing attire. You must dress up for the Zulu Time event in a few more minutes."

I turned and scanned each room with a confused brow. "Where are the other...?"

Henoana turned and smiled to see Igala. "I brought along a new re-designer dress for you, dear. Please, go and wash off the nasty brown colored raccoon eye sockets before you change into your new re-designer gown. We are all wearing the color of emerald green. The color of green used the represent the color of money in the ancient days of royals. I don't want that nasty brown makeup on your new emerald colored gown. Hurry, now! Before, the Regulators return and fetch us for our glamour presentation within Zulu Time."

"Yes ma'am." I back stepped with a sigh of worry and scooted around the island and my dad, dashing down the long hallway.

Her grandmother Oltole back stepped from the island and slowly spun around with a stern face, moving ahead toward the bathroom, following behind the dress train of Igala. "I will assist Igala."

At 09:05 am, I entered the Girl's Bathroom, stopped and leaned against the sink, grabbing a clean cloth, flipping on the water.

Oltole moved through the archway and stopped, standing on the side of the long cabinet of wash sinks with a stern face to see the nose profile of Igala. "Where have you been all this time, Igala? I was worried about you."

I leaned over the wet sink with a frown and drowned the clean dry cloth with water. "I have the funny feeling that you were the only one, Granny." I washed the brown makeup from my face.

She exhaled. "There are rumors going around."

I rubbed the cloth with soap, creating bubbles. "What rumors?"

She frowned. "You have learned over time, when a person is victimized then he or she can charge a claim within Zulu Time."

I laughed. "The hard way..." I leaned down and rubbed the soapy cloth over the brown makeup.

She exhaled. "I and the Regulators were absolutely stunned the family of the teens placed a third claim against you, Igala. But I and the Regulators have collected some valuable information from the unfavorable incidents."

I lifted a wet face with a frown, seeing the brown makeup, "Unfavorable incidents, where did you learn that word?"

"I found all kinds of silly terms inside the blog for the Zulu Time rules. People die, if..."

I rinsed off the dirty cloth with clean water and more soap with a puff. "I almost died."

She doesn't smile. "Igala, you were invited on the Tour of Zulu Time which visited inside each Society Cities. May I seek? What did you observe there within each city?"

I wring the wet cloth with bubbles of soap with a sigh. "I observed that the other people are only intrigued and interested with the latest re-designed clothing, purses, com-ds, even the tubs of re-generated food stuffs. They totally ignore the natural beauty of the land like the sandy beaches, the grassy hilly peaks, the cool caverns. I enjoyed visiting the hot spots. All citizens are really one dimensional selfish."

She nodded with a stern face. "You have learned a valuable lesson even as a teen. Yes, each citizen to a degree is selfish with greed for stuff that Zulu Time can bring. The citizens of Society City Four love Zulu Time."

I exhaled. "The citizens obsess in Zulu Time." I leaned down over the wet sink and washed off more of the thick brown makeup, listening to my grandmother.

She nodded with a smile. "You are very observant, Igala. From my long term experiences of a long life, the citizens can't live without Zulu Time. What do you think would happen if Zulu Time became removed from their greedy life?"

I lifted an almost clean face and rinsed the dirty cloth again underneath the running water with a frown. "The citizens of Society City Four would probably riot with a set of shotguns and a pair of steak knives." I lifted the fresh cloth and removed the tiny bits of brown makeup with a smile.

"You are wise with usual knowledge beyond your teen years. Yes, I have seen that, too."

I cleaned my face with a frown. "What does that mean, Granny?"

She nodded with a frown. "There have been a set of violence riots and vocal yelling protests, since you left the Bowl ring, yesterday afternoon."

"Good thing, I left." I cleaned my face with a giggle.

She exhaled. "I do not applaud your decision, escaping from the Bowl arena, but I admire your guts and glamour."

"Dangerous action..."

She nodded with a stern face. "There are many young teens like you, who think the same way, the righteous way. There are not many young teens, unlike you, who want to join the Regulators and quiet the rebellion for a fight for right and justice, Igala."

I dropped the wet cloth from a freshly clean face and turned with a gasp to see my grandmother. "I am going to marry..."

"Ucal, yes, he will be an excellent husband and a good protector. He is going to become a Regulator like you. I am pleased with your decision. And I am honored to meet a future Regulator. I want to wish all of my luck to the both of you. When is the marriage taking place?"

" _Mom says to come out of the bathroom and get dressed. The Regulators will be here, soonest."_ Segue shouted with a frown and stood outside the open archway of the Girl's Bathroom, back stepping and spun around with a grin, dashing ahead down the long hallway into the room for one more jump onto of the bed mattress. He couldn't do that at home without getting punished.

Inside the Girl's Bathroom, I turned with a fake smile and a nod to see my grandmother, probably for the last time. I was getting married to Dfee. I loved Dfee, not Ucal. I could see that my biological family unit was not going to be satisfied until they completely ruined my dreams. I was not letting that happen. I smiled. "Wow, you are informed, Granny. I'm so sorry that I didn't want to tattle you with my good news."

She slowly spun around to face the archway and moved ahead with a smile and a nod. "I'm an old wise owl, dear."

I pulled up beside her and slowly moved down the hallway. I was not worried about the Regulators. They could not escort the Smith family without all the members. So they could wait for me to get dressed. I turned with a gasp at the object. "Where did you get a com-d? When did you receive a com-d? It is a necklace one?"

She moved ahead with a smile and stared down into the tiny screen of the com-d. "One day, when your mother went shopping at the Re-gen Mall. I asked for me. She purchased it. Your parents had received all the coin and the additional assets from Kallidin and her biological families plus the five other families that died inside the Bowl, yesterday afternoon."

"Why did you get one? You said that you would never use a com-d, Granny."

She exhaled. "I was disturbed by the de..."

"Me, too," I exhaled with sadness.

"I want to vote now within the Zulu Time for my choice of the winner. I can only do that when I own a com-d."

I nodded with a stern face. "Wow, you have changed, Granny."

"Everything has changed, Igala." She moved forward and growled down at her necklace com-d.

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance. Everything was changing for me, not her, not my mom, not my dad, not Ucal. I slowly strolled down the hallway, hoping to perturb my mom and the team of Regulators, too.

Oltole frowned. "You seemed to be surprised when you entered the Cee suites of dead cold bodies inside the walls."

I exhaled. "You don't have to keep mentioning that gross fact. Yes, I was totally surprised to see my family members back here inside the Cee chamber of horrors suites."

She laughed. "You enjoy using the scary terms, too. Do you know why you are here, Igala?"

"I am a..."

"I am not surprised either. I told you and warned you that you would be back. However, this is the last one, the last time inside Zulu Time."

I frowned. "I'm so sorry."

"I am so sorry, too. That schooler fiend Lexedo, did you see her inside the Zulu Time Ball?"

"No."

She exhaled. "Well, the Regulator accepted the car wreck claim from Lexedo. You said that she was the last teen inside your car."

"Yes ma'am."

She exhaled. "Well, we cannot do anything to stop the upcoming event. Zulu Time begins shortly again."

"Yes ma'am."

She stopped and stood in sideway in front of the closed metal door. The private bedroom chamber had been used by Igala for the last two Zulu Time events. Maybe, the room was lucky. Oltole hoped and prayed that it was. She looked down with a sad face at the dirty floor. "You are dead, Igala."

I turned with a gasp to see her gray hair roots. "What the heck? I'm not dead. I live. I breathe. I am standing right here."

"Let me explain, Igala!"

"Yes, please do." I growled at her.

She looked up with a sad face. "You have been hunted like a rabbit for stew."

I exhaled. "I am not a rabbit. I am a human."

"You are labeled as a criminal to win or lose inside Zulu Time."

I growled. "I know that. You didn't need to remind me, Granny." I shake my curls with a sour frown.

"Yes, I need to remind you. You survived Zulu Time. I saw the tomb and the name of dead Minki inside the Vee Building. She died. She died inside Zulu Time. You killed her. Therefore, you won Zulu Time. Thus, we were freed of Zulu Time. Then Kallidin was killed in Zulu Time. You won again. Thus, we were all freed of Zulu Time. Now, Lexedo is present here inside Zulu Time. Will you win, again, Igala?"

I swallowed the bile back down a tight throat. "I will."

She frowned. "I am dead, too, Igala."

I gasped. "What does that mean, Granny?"

"My life depends upon you. Do you know that?"

"I will win. I promise."

She looked down with a stern face and tapped on the tiny screen of the new com-d. "I have been intrigued with the rules of Zulu Time. There are numerous pages. The pages go on and on, making for good nighttime sleeping. However, this is an interesting tidbit of information that was buried deep down inside the rules of Zulu Time. Any and all participants inside the Bowl arena also reflect the lives of their individual biological families."

I gasped in alert. "That is interesting."

"That means, if you lose inside the Bowl, then we lose, too."

"I understand, Grandmother." I faked a smile and wondered about the importance of the other one's life and love like my fiancé Dfee.

" _Get ready, Igala, now!"_ Henoana turned with a sour frown with a loud screech, standing beside the marble island, fluffing the new re-designer emerald dress with both hands. "Change into the emerald gown! So that we all match and glitter in emerald green tones."

"Yes ma'am." I scooted around Oltole with a sour frown and stood in front of the door with a puff of annoyance.

She whispered into the eardrum of Igala with a stern face. "Your mother picked out the gown, but I selected all the accessories. Please, wear all the accessories, Igala. They will look lovely with the dress."

"Yes ma'am." I stared with a puff at the metal door.

"One more thing! When we all go inside the Zulu Time room, you must call out loud the word, solo."

I gasped with shock. Ucal whispered the same word solo to Igala inside the Zulu Time Ball. I turned with a worried brow to see her frown. "Why?"

"Just said, solo. You will understand, dear." She back stepped with a stern face and scooted around Igala, moving ahead to stand next to Henoana.

I turned with a sour frown and slapped the metal door.

The door opened.

I entered and moved toward the bed mattress that was covered in solid black bedspread and stopped, standing with a gasp and stared down at the dress that was outstretched on top of the bedspread.

The gown was an emerald sparkling color and an ankle-length form without a set of sleeves and a collar bone and a neck fabric. I whined with a sissy tone, "A strapless and sleeveless, again, emerald color gown." The gown looked similar to the one that I was wearing in sexy bright red which did not attract the Regulators. I wondered what Dfee was doing, now. I undressed and dropped down the old garments, standing naked, changing into the new undergarments that were posed on top of the gown. I reached out and grabbed the dress, dragging it over the bedcovers, seeing the new object on top of the bedcovers with a gasp. I reached out with the other hand and touched the object, whipping back my hand with a hiss. The object was a garter belt in the color of rich black soft leather that fit around a thigh leg.

Attached to the leather garter belt, there was a black shiny object, a closed switchblade. I recognized the deadly design, since Dfee had one and exhibited it during the last Bowl event.

I gasped in horror. My grandmother said that I was dead. I must call out the word, solo, inside the Zulu Time room.

Inside the Zulu Time Ball, Ucal didn't promise a set of sweet words that he would be inside the Bowl event with Igala. Then, he told Igala to say the word, solo, too.

I sobbed and held back the rolling hot tears of death. I will die. I will fight alone inside the Bowl against Lexedo and her family members. I whispered for my eardrums only. "Yes, I am dead." I dropped the gown down to the floor and reached over, grabbing and lifted the garter belt. It was light weight even with the baby switchblade. I touched and caressed the smooth black metal, jerking out the weapon, lifting and held near my frown, pressing the tiny red button. A sharp six-inch blade popped up and gleamed within the artificial lamps of the bedroom ceiling. I reached over and cupped a palm over the dull side of the blade, closing the knife shut. I reached over and popped the button with an index finger, practicing with the deadly weapon, repeating the procedure over and over again.

Her parents, Henoana and Genic were so gullible to believe that Ucal would come to the rescue of the Smith family for the fourth time.

Ucal had done enough and too much for the Smith Family inside each Zulu Time event. He couldn't help this time to save Igala.

I must fight and save my person and my soul.

Her grandmother Oltole worried that her granddaughter would die inside the Bowl. Then her grandmother and the other members of the Smith family would die in front of the wall of criminals by a row of golden faceless Regulators with an individual hand gun inside the Zulu Time room, immediately.

I slapped the blade shut and reached out, replacing the knife back down into the garter belt. I lifted and secured the belt around my left thigh, since I was right-dominated with a fighting hand. I strapped the leather tight, almost cutting off the blood circulation around the skin tissue with a gasp and lifted my leg up into the air from the floor, jiggling it side to side. The garter belt was securely fastened around my leg without falling off.

During the Tag Team, I didn't have time to change my clothes or acquire a weapon. It would be the same time constraint during this round of Zulu Time with the Solo command. I guessed.

I dropped the leg onto the floor and reached down for the dress, wiggling a body side to side, dressing up in the beautiful gown of death. I exhaled with a puff of worry and fright, inhaling with angry about the rotten situation of a simple car accident and stopped and stared at the new object, slamming my breasts inside the strapless and sleeveless evening gown with frustrating. "I can't fight naked, if my dress falls down to my kneecaps." I dropped the bodice down to the waist line and reached down, jerking out one of the two long emerald green colored fancy clothing straps which was used to hang the clothing item on a hanger inside your personal closet after wearing and for next social event. I slipped an arm through the fancy clothing strap and posed it over a naked collar bone. Then I placed the second fancy clothing strap of matching emerald green fabric on the other collar bone. There, my dress would stay put over my breasts while I fought to the death.

On top of the black colored bedcover, there was a glittering emerald diamond necklace that greatly complimented my naked throat.

Her grandmother Oltole had selected all the accessories and told Igala to wear them.

I guess the glittering gem necklace would re-focus the eyeballs up and on the throat, instead of the weird limp from a switchblade on the inner thigh of my left leg. I reached out and grabbed the necklace. The stones were smooth and silky to my finger pads. I gasped with shock. This was one of the pieces of the jewelry collection, coming from my visit within the underground cavern environment of Society City Three.

Her mom had taken home all the gems yesterday as Igala battled inside the Bowl event.

I placed the gems over a naked neck with a laugh and a grin. "And my grandmother had stolen them back for me to wear today for my funeral. Poetic justice!" I secured the jewelry latch and swung around, moving ahead toward the door, dragging the long dress train in frustration. I reached out and slapped the metal. The door slid open.

At 09:30 am, I marched ahead from the bedroom chamber into the hallway with a blank stare to face death.

Henoana fiddled with both hands and straighten the emerald colored hair band on the top of the hairy skull of Laddie with a frown. "There, it is perfect, now. Don't touch it again, Laddie! It has to stay in place."

Laddie stood in front of her mom and reached up, touching the hair band. The band crossed the top of the skull and scratched the back of her two tender earlobes with an annoyed face and a sissy whine. "It hurts."

She slapped the hands of her daughter Laddie away from the hair band with a frown, "Only for a little while, I promise. You are little princess, today. We will be done with Zulu Time in a short time period. Be pretty for our exhibition." Laddie dropped down the hands and crossed both arms with a sour pout in silence. Henoana continued to fiddle with the hair and the dress of Laddie in silence.

I halted with a gasp without dropping open a mouth and stood, staring at each family member. Each person wore an emerald colored outfit with a set of gem stones on the hairy skull.

Her dad Genic wore an emerald colored sporting jacket of satin with a white dress shirt, a pair of new re-designer blue jeans without the holes, and a pair of polished purple and green cowboy boots. He didn't have a bowtie of any color. His face was clean shaven without a set of funny colored symbols that was required to attend Zulu Time. However, he wore a single forehead band of emerald stone over the white skin tone that gleamed within the artificial lamps from the ceiling.

I gasped. The forehead band had belonged to Dfee, when he visited Igala inside the Society City Five, the cavern.

Her brother Segue was dressed exactly like his father in the same green clothing and cowboy boots, wearing an emerald nose ring that was really clipped onto the side of his face.

Her sister Laddie wore a silk emerald colored ankle-length dress with a pair of emerald tinted shoes without the facial designs and a pair of girly hand gloves. She wore a hair band which was made of tiny rows of emerald stones.

Her grandmother, Oltole stood beside Henoana and stared at Igala, wearing a satin ankle-length gown of emerald lace with a pair of flat matching colors shoes without a pair of gloves and a set of funny facial designs. She wore a set of dangling emerald gems on each earlobe that touched the lace collar the dark green colored gown.

Her mother, Henoana continued to fiddle with the dress of Laddie, wearing a satin emerald color ankle-length gown with a pair of matching emerald shoes without a pair of gloves, missing the facial designs. She wore the emerald stone tiara over the back hairy skull as the stones gleamed within the artificial lamps on the ceiling.

I advanced a little closer with a gasp and stopped, standing in front of my mom with a puzzled brow. "What is this? Where are the gloves?"

Henoana squatted down over the dirty floor and fiddled with the long dress on Laddie with a smile. "We are not wearing gloves."

I frowned. "Where are the funny face designs on each face?"

She continued to squat on the floor and fiddled with the dress on Laddie with a smile. "We are not wearing these ugly face designs? The makeup itches my delicate skin."

I exhaled. "Why are all of you wearing a set of glittering emerald green colored gems?"

She continued to squat on the floor and fiddled with the dress on laddie with a smile. "The gems spark nicely on our pale colored skin. We are starting a new trend here within Zulu Time."

I whispered for my eardrums only. "Zulu Time is only a death trend."

Henoana stood and shoved Laddie to the side, "You are late, Igala. You're lucky that the Regulator did not show before now." She looked up with a smile and a gasp. "What are you wearing?"

I reached up and tapped on one of the fancy clothing straps with a grin in silence. Normally, the twin straps were tucked down into the evening dress and not displayed over the collar bone.

Henoana frowned. "Where do you get that emerald necklace, Igala?"

I reached over and gently caressed the necklace of gem stones with a smirk in silence. I received all the emerald colored pieces of jewelry when I visited the Society City Five for my Tour of Zulu Time.

The glittering golden tinted doors parted open.

A row of four Regulators entered and stood between the space gasp without smiling. One droned like a machine at each back spine on each family member. "It is time to enter Zulu Time, Smith family."

Henoana leaned over with a sneer into the smirk of Igala. "You will remove that necklace before you enter into the Bowl. Do you hear and understand me? Where is the collector bar from the Tour of Zulu Time? Since, you have ruined any additional visitations into the other Society Cities for a collection of more coin which is our payment for your absence."

I reached down and patted the silky dress where the switchblade sorta caressed the side of my thigh with a smile. "Inside the tiny pouch..."

She huffed. "You will remove it after Zulu Time. I want that given back to me for depositing into our coin account."

"Yes ma'am." I nodded with a smirk.

Henoana swung around with a huff and reached out, grabbing and jerked the hand of her son Segue into her dress. They both moved ahead toward the open archway, following behind the back spines of Genic and Laddie.

Oltole stood in place and fiddled with the new com-d with a smile. I moved ahead with a sour frown, desiring to wiggle an exposed pink color tongue at the back spine on my mom but didn't. Oltole spun around and moved with Igala with a stern face of worry in silence.

Oltole and I exited the suites and slowly strolled down the avenue of the dead like an afternoon walk.

Oltole stared down with a grin at the com-d and tapped on the tiny screen. "This is fascinating."

"Yeah, fascinating," I exhaled with a puff of annoyance and worry, slowly following behind the back spine on each family member, turning with a blank face to see the white marble floor and the matching walls of tombs of the dead bodies without feeling creepy. I felt angry that I was forced back into Zulu Time for the fourth time due to coin accumulation and a lousy Hall friend.

She moved ahead and stared down at the com-d. "I have enjoyed studying the Zulu Time rules, but I find them confusing."

"Yeah, confusing," I turned the wall corner and looked down at the shiny wooden floor and the gleaming walls. Hmm! The Regulators provided good maid service besides killing people inside the Zulu Time room. I looked up to see the polished wooden ceiling, too.

She strolled beside Igala and stared with a grin down to the com-d. "I find them very clear."

"Very clear..." I looked down with a blank face and slowly moved behind the back spines of my family members in the long dress train. The dress train slowly dragged over the smooth surface as I appeared like princess with the glittering emerald necklace. I thought it was crazy that my mom wanted to exhibit her face and her gems in front of the entire audience within Society City Four. I wanted to wear a paper bag over my face without recognition.

She strolled beside Igala and read the com-d. "And I don't find any single reference inside the old and ancient archive Zulu Time records or the current Zulu Time rules regarding any one family unit repeating Zulu Time for multiple times as the criminal..."

I whisper with a worried brow. "Criminal."

Geez! I might be wearing a red colored tape over my entire hairy skull while posed on the wall of criminals. Maybe, I should not say anything inside Zulu Time. Then the audience would judge me guilty and that would be it. The end of me! No more Zulu Time adventures for me!

Oltole continued to stroll beside Igala with a low tone and read the com-d. "Something is wrong." She looked up and turned with a puzzled brow to see the nose profile on Igala. "I do believe that we should have never been invited to Zulu Time more than once."

"Once is enough for me." I laughed.

At 09:46 am, I advanced through the archway of the Cee team hallway of the Zulu Time Building with a giggle and then a gasp, slowly moving forward, turning side to side without dropping open a mouth of polished white teeth. The glass cages were filled with people, who were not dressed in a fancy evening gown or a colorful tuxedo with a bowtie. No person wore a pair of gloves or a facial design of colorful symbols.

I guess that my mom was wrong. Henoana didn't exhibit the face without decoration. Someone else had beaten her to it.

Oltole continued to stroll beside Igala and read the com-d. "Ucal is wrong. Something is wrong here."

"Yeah, everything is wrong here." I moved ahead and stared into each glass cage with intrigue.

The people were separated into a set of weird groups. There were two people inside one cage. Then there were eight people inside a different cage. Then each cage contained an odd number of people which was very strange.

I studied each cage. "What is going on here in Zulu Time?"

Oltole looked up and turned with a sour frown to see each glass cage. "During the live Zulu Time event, these are the protestors that have been rioting and riding around the city, causing malady and mischief. But the Regulators have been acting as the judges. So, the protestors have been sentenced into Zulu Time. This has been happening, since yesterday, since you escaped from the Bowl arena."

I gasped. "I don't do this."

I was really confused and turned to the side, entering an empty glass cage with my family without a sweet smile or a hand wave to the posed Regulator at the open door. I felt worry and sadness for my fiancé Dfee, caressing the new emerald green silk dress with both hands in nervousness. I, not my family members, was entering Zulu Time and the Bowl arena for a third time. I stopped and stood a few feet in front of the glass door next to my grandmother Oltole.

At 09:55 am, the glass door closed and entrapped the Smith family for a third time inside the glass cage.

Henoana stopped and squatted down inside the wall corner with her son Segue, leaning over with a smile and a set of secret whispers in his face. He giggled with a grin and a nod back into her face with happiness.

Genic stopped and stood in front of the wall of glass that illuminated in rows of silver and golden lines, holding Laddie with one bicep. Zulu Time had not started. It was a few seconds shy of the new hour of the afternoon. He reached up and tapped the glass. A vertical line in red colors appeared onto the glass.

I stared at the vertical red line on the wall of glass for a second time.

Genic tapped on the top of the red line, sending the color of red down to the end point. Then the wall of glass turned a very dull blackish color.

I stared at the black colored wall of glass without emotion. I had learned inside the second Zulu Time that the newer wall of glass models allowed for child protection. Thus, the screen could be darkened by the guardian, where the control switch was located at the top of the wall unit.

Oltole stood in place next to Igala and stared at her family members with a worried heart and a worried brow in silence. "You did not do this. But someone did."

I gasped. "What does that mean?" Motion caught both of the periphery vision on side of my eyeballs. I swung around with a gasp to see each glass cage.

Several two-person teams of golden tinted Regulators had entered the Zulu Time hallway and moved ahead, stopping and stood in front of almost all the glass cages. One opened the door. The other Regulator motioned with a golden tinted hand for each person to leave the cage while the other hand pointed the metal door that led into the Zulu Time room.

I stared in silence and wonderment at the gang of common street people without wearing the fancy clothes or the face paint.

Oltole slowly spun around and stared at each person, leaning over with a stern face and a whisper into the eardrum of Igala. "Those are some of the protestors. There has been a rash of riots. The Regulators have been shooting and killing the ones that carried guns outside on the streets and in front of the buildings. Then, the other ones without the guns have been rounded up and coming into Zulu Time."

I stared at each person. Each protestor was rowdy with a set of shouts and shoves at each Regulator, exhibiting angry and violence. The Regulators corralled each person and shoved the group of protestors toward the closed metal door in front of the Zulu Time room. I frowned with confusion. "There are more protestors being herded into the glass cages like animals."

She frowned. "I told you before that there has been a wave of continuous riots of people. The Regulators have been rounding up the more violent persons and dumping them directly here inside Zulu Time."

I gasped with confusion. "But protesting is legal. That is not an illegal act."

She frowned. "I know that. You know that. But the Regulators didn't know that."

I slowly turned and followed the group of protestors with a puzzled brow. "There must be another explanation." The Regulators shoved each person until the entire group huddled near the closed metal door.

The Cee hallway doorway slid open.

I turned and stared with a puzzled brow into the wall of glass inside the non-occupied glass cage without audio sound.

10:05 am

Zulu Time room in tan hue

Inside the Zulu Time, room a pale skinned female exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female exited from the other side door as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room without a smile and a snarl in unison, "Jaime and Jackie."

Jackie stood in place, wearing a short dress of purple and golden vertical stripes with a pair of thigh-boots of purple without a pair of hand gloves. Her pale face, a neck, and a naked collar bone were painted in a smear of dull colors of green, pink, and blue. There must have been a colorful facial design before. Now, the colors were smeared and the facial pattern was gone. Her blonde hair was down and swirled around a tired face without the pretty colored patterns. She sneered into the microphone. "Jackie. Zulu Time, a specific place and time for a judge, a jury, and an executioner of justice. The rules, when an injustice occurs, each party is here."

Jamie stood beside her sister Jackie, wearing a short strapless dress in white and a pair of thigh high boots of white without a pair of colorful hand gloves. Her dark skin of a face, a neck, both back shoulder blades, and a collar bone showed smeared colors of orange, black, and red where a facial design had been before. Her long black colored hair was draped down a back spine without colors. She sneered into the microphone. "Jamie. Voice your justification case for twenty seconds. While the rest of the people watch and eat. After twenty seconds, the citizens judge you winner or dead."

Each female spun around with a sneer and moved back to a closed door on the opposite wall.

The Cee team doorway slid open first.

Jaime spun around from the open archway with a sneer, leading a line of people in front of a low and long bench of soft tan fabric and stopped. Each person party stopped and bumped into each other, hitting back spines and buttholes, huddling into a very large group, growling and mumbling at the girls, the room, and the glass screens, wearing a set of regulator clothing, not the elegant ankle-length gowns or a tuxedos of pretty colors. Each face was not decorated with a colorful symbol but snarled in fury and mouth spit.

The Vee team doorway slid open next.

Jackie spun away from the open archway with a sneer, leading a line of eighteen people in front of the same bench and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and pointed at the large group of protestors with a set of mumbles and grunts without looking at tiny glass screens. Each person wore a business suit that represented their personal company. Each cheekbone was naked and as, each mouth mumbles a set of curse words at the protestors.

Jamie and Jackie spun around met in middle without a smile, exhaling with a huff of annoyance.

Jackie sneered into the microphone. "Jackie. The Vee team is here. My Jamie stands behind the extra-large Cee team. The Vee team is represented by all the vendors that own stores and diners within Society City Four that has been vandalized or robbed by the evil gang of protesters. This is the justification crime for true justice by the other nice citizens of Society City Four. You get twenty seconds for the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Say your peace within twenty seconds. Since each one of you are accountable of the guilt, too, including all the immediate family members present here inside Zulu Time."

Jaime snarled into the microphone. "Jaime. Cee team over there, they are the protesters. Remember which party you root for justice. Ya got twenty seconds. Go!"

Jackie handed the microphone to the middle aged man of the Vee team with a smile and a nod. Her sister Jamie handed the microphone to the young adult male of the Cee team with a sneer. They back stepped away from the bench and the two debating teams, stopping and stood against a small spot on the curved wall between the rows of tiny black glass screens, crossing both arms with a sneer and a nod. Each tiny black screen was six inches long by six inches wide that contained a face of a registered viewer, who owned a com-d or a communication devise to see and hear the world, especially the world of Society City Four.

The twins stared at the nose profile of each team member, saying in unison with a sneer. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The first person in the line of eighteen members of the Vee team, the middle aged male wore a brown colored business suit with a naked face, lacking a colorful facial design, without a pair of naked hands and a bowtie, sneering into the microphone. "I am the representative for only a few of the businesses here..."

"So what?" The first person in the huddle of sixty-six people of the Cee team, a young adult male wore a blue colored business suit with a green necktie with a pair of naked hands. His face was colored in strips of green and purple with a sneer into the microphone. "You are dead. You should not be here with us."

The Vee team male exhaled into the microphone. "The issue..."

The second person in the huddle with the other Cee team members reached out and grabbed the microphone, wearing a business suit of green with a pair of naked hands and a face of black and red horizontal lines. "The issue is you."

The third person in the line of sixty-six members of the Cee team reached over and stole the microphone from the second person. He was a young aged male, wearing a pair of new blue jeans and a new re-designer shirt with a pair of naked hands. His face was smeared with zigzag colors with a snarl. "We have the right to protest. We have the right to speak out our opinions. We have the right to our views."

The fifth person in the line of eighteen members of the Vee team shuffled ahead and stood beside the elderly women, reaching out and stole the microphone, wearing a yellow re-designer dress with a matching re-designer purse and a stern face with a pair of re-designer yellow gloves, saying with a sour frown into the microphone. "You have the right to shout, scream out nasty words with your opinions..."

The huddle of the Cee team sounded with a set of shouts and cheers, hand clapping, whistling.

The elderly woman of the Vee team cleared a throat. "However, you do not have the right to black airship traffic, not on your home city street corner, and to smash glass windows, not on your house, and to steal merchandise, not with your coin, and to destroy property, not yours. You do not have the right to eat food, not inside your refrigerator. This is the just and justice of Zulu Time. Thus, I command Zulu Time to respond and award the offenses of injustice."

The young child in the huddle of the sixty-six members of the Cee team started crying, turning with a yell to see her mother, "Mama, what here? Why me here, Mama?"

The voices of Jamie and Jackie sneered into the microphones in unison. "The twenty second deadline has expired."

Jamie stood and stared with a smirk at each dark tinted screen. "You have heard the justification case. Vote now on your com-d. Vote now on your com-d."

Jackie stood and stared with a smirk at each black tinted screen. "The voting is done. Illuminate all the glass screens in Zulu Time."

All the tiny glass screens showed a black back ground with one single letter in white.

The voice Jamie smiled in the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Finally, I am not shocked. Are you not shocked, Jackie?"

The voice of Jackie smiled in the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "Yeah, finally I am not shocked, too. Are you really not shocked, Jamie?"

The voices of Jamie and Jackie smirked within the darkness in unison. "The highest mathematical number wins the justification case. The highest number of the two letters is V for the victim team."

The tiny lights on the millions of glass screens went black. The dark room echoed in a series of loud screams and harsh curses plus the sounds of soft rips and tears of fabric. Then the room was silent.

A few seconds later, all the overhead lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room.

One the forward and both side walls, there were sixty-six objects that were seated in various heights, leaning against one of three walls. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages from the hair roots down to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jackie twirled around to see each screen with a smile near the entrance wall. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, the Vee team member has won and must participate and accept the judgment. Thus, the Cee team lost. Now, there are sixty-six members of the losing Cee team that has been captured, bandaged, and seated on the floor in the dull color of beige and the pretty color of red against the forward wall and both side walls for just and justice of the Vee team. Each Cee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment too. Thus, the Cee team is sentenced to death by means of the fun and creative methods of each Vee team member on the U-shaped wall of criminals."

Jamie swirled around to see each glass screen with a smile. "Vee team, please select your pleasure. Slap the soft fabric lid on top of the bench as it reveals your weapon selection. Pick out whatever suites your heart and your hand. This part of Zulu Time is the choice of the winning team. The only rule is that each Vee team member must discharge one weapon and kill all the criminals. The audience of viewers is full of true victims of violence with the on-going violent and nasty protestors and protests."

The first person, the middle aged male of Vee team turned and shifted down to the end of the long bench and stopped, standing in front of the first object of the side wall of criminals with a sneer.

Each member of the Vee team turned to one side and shifted down along the long bench, stopping and stood in front of the side wall or the rear wall or the other side wall with a sneer, spreading out into three groups. Each group stood in front of the side wall, the other side wall, or the forward wall of criminals.

The first person of the Vee team, the middle aged male reached down and slapped the soft fabric. The lid lifted upright and displayed an array of deadly weapons. Each Vee team member reached down and selected an individual weapon, lifting it into the air, showing a hand gun.

The rows of U-shaped criminals wiggled side to side on top of the cloth floor, moaning like a set of haunting ghosts on the forward wall. A family unit was not distinguished. There were tiny objects that sat inside the lap of an adult tan and red colored object. There were tiny objects standing between a set of two adult objects.

Each object did not hang down from the wall of criminals in order of the family unit, such like, father, mother, and child. Instead, the wall showed a unique configuration of twenty wiggling bodies of elderly, adults, teenagers, children, and infants on the floor in front of one of the side walls. There were twenty-seven wiggling bodies on elderly, adults, teenagers, children, and infants on the floor in front of the forward wall. There were twenty wiggling bodies of elderly, adults, teenagers, children, and infants on the floor in front of the other side wall.

The center of the room was empty.

Jackie did not twirl and stared at the wall of criminals with a smirk. "There is a massive number of sitting objects on the forward wall, the side wall, and the other side. As a matter of fact, the entire three walls are covered with criminals who are individually taped in red and tan colors. The forward wall is fifty feet which is six hundred inches. So, each body overlaps and sits side by side which is about twenty-two inches across in length. There are twenty-seven criminals on that wall."

Jamie did not swirl and smirked at the wall of criminals. "Both side walls are thirty feet or three hundred and sixty inches. So, each body overlaps and sits side by side against the wall and down on the floor. The average collar bone is twenty-two inches across in length, so there are twenty criminals on each side wall."

Jackie smiled at the wall of criminals. "But, this is not a prob, thou. Each Vee team member stands with a pair of re-designer shoes apart inside a group of six business person, holding a hand gun in front of several wiggling objects. Thus, each Vee team member will hit each object multiple times until the tan and red tape turns into the color of black of death."

Jamie smirked at the wall of criminals. "There are three huddles of Vee team members. One team faces the forward wall. One team faces the side wall. The third team faces the other side wall with a hand gun. This justification case cannot be completed until all the objects have turned black in death on some part of the wrapped body. Each Vee team member has been granted permission to fire all at the same time. Or Zulu Time will be here until tomorrow evening. We must move on with the show. So, each Vee team member will fire at will and at any object on the forward or two side walls."

Jackie smirked at the wall of criminals. "This configuration is highly usually but not highly illegal."

Jamie frowned at the back spine on each Vee team member. "However, this Vee team has thoroughly read the rules of Zulu Time."

Jackie smiled with a nod. "Each member holds a weapon. Each member is ready for action against the wall of the criminals. This action requires a row of Regulators. So, on with the show, Jackie! I am thrilled, Jamie." She spun around in the pretty dress with a smirk and dashed toward the Cee team archway, disappearing in the darkness.

"I am more thrilled, Jackie." Jaime twirled around in the pretty gown and strolled toward the Cee team archway with a smirk.

A line of golden tinted Regulators entered the Zulu Time room from the Vee team doorway and then split into two separate groups. One regulator stopped and stood beside each member of the Vee team, passing out a set of earplugs for the loud hand gun noise, clicking off the safety on each gun. Then, the team turned in unison as one unit and exited through the Cee team member door, disappearing into the darkness.

Jackie and Jaime appeared and stood inside the set of opposite archways on each side of the Zulu Time room for safety with a smile and a nod in unison. "Aim highest and lowest..."

Both the doors closed shut.

The first person of the Vee team, the middle aged male lifted an arm and then dropped the arm down to his leg with a stern face.

Each Vee team member lifted and aimed a two-fisted hand gun, gritting the teeth, pressing the trigger finger. A spraying array of bullets released and fired, sailing through the air waves, hitting numerous tan and red colored tapes that represented the skull, the neck, the heart, the stomach, the legs and other body parts on numerous wiggling objects on the U-shaped wall of criminals.

The room echoed in ghostly moans and screams of pain within the air waves as each bullet killed numerous person at a time. "Argh, waah, aww, uoo, aahh, iyhiih, and pfft..."

Finally, each oval shaped object on the three walls of criminals turned rich black in death and stillness.

The Zulu Time room went black.

The voices of Jackie and Jaime said with a smile within the darkness. "Done!"

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "Stick around."

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness. "We have more dead bodies coming in Zulu Time."

The wall of glass in every home within Society City Four changed into a set of wiggling lines of brown and yellow colors with a musical song of loud trumpets and saxophones of jazz music.

At 10:25 am, inside the glass cage with my family member, I stood in front of the door with a set of parted lips in silence of worry and stared at the wall of glass inside the other glass cage.

Genic continued to play with his younger daughter Laddie on the floor. Henoana continued to laugh with her son Segue in the other wall corner with fun.

Oltole stood next to Igala and stared down at the com-d with a stern face. "Say, solo! Do not forget to do that."

I continued to stare at the wall of glass with the wiggling brown and yellow colors without hearing the cheery song. "Why do I say the word, solo?

She exhaled and stared down at the com-d. "That is the only option left for you, Igala. You have already exhausted all the other options within Zulu Time. The other options were the Tag and the Tag Team. You only have the option of Solo. Apparently, a team can use any of the selected option during Zulu Time. However, I have discovered that no other team that previously survived came back into the Zulu Time and selected another option. This is strange. This is weird. This is usual."

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance. I was so tired to people telling me what to do. My mom ordered me around. Ucal ordered me around. The Regulators told me what to do. Now, my grandmother was doing the same thing. I turned and sneered into her nose profile, since we were both the same height. "And if I do not yell out the word, solo, what the fudge happens then?"

She continued to stare with a stern face down at the com-d. "There will be six people alone on the forward wall inside Zulu Time."

I gasped with shock, turning to see the single person inside the glass cage on the other side of my glass cage.

The individual wore a set of walking shorts with a slightly dirty shirt without a pair of hand glove or a fancy tuxedo or a bowtie. His face was painted in a set of golden circles. He spun around and skipped out the door with a smile and stood behind the back spine on Jackie.

I turned and stared to see the illuminated wall of glass, seeing the tan color room of Zulu Time.

At 10:47 am, a set of two doors opened on each side of the curved wall inside the interior room of Zulu Time, marking the beginning of the next program for all glass walls.

A pale skinned female exited from one of two side doors. A dark skinned female exited from the other side door as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile in unison, "Jaime and Jackie."

Jackie stood in place, wearing the same short dress, pair of thigh-boots without a pair of hand gloves. Her pale face, a neck, and a naked collar bone were painted in a smear of dull colors of green, pink, and blue. Her blonde hair was down and swirled around a tired face without the pretty colored patterns. She smiled into the microphone. "Jackie. Zulu Time, a specific place and time for a judge, a jury, and an executioner of justice. The rules, when an injustice occurs, each party is here."

Jamie stood beside her sister Jackie, wearing the same short strapless dress, the same pair of thigh high boots without a pair of colorful hand gloves. Her dark skin of a face, a neck, both back shoulder blades, and a collar bone showed smeared colors of orange, black, and red where a facial design had been before. Her long black colored hair was draped down a back spine without colors. She smiled into the microphone. "Jamie. Voice your justification case for twenty seconds. While the rest of the people watch and eat. After twenty seconds, the citizens judge you winner or dead."

Each female spun around with a smile and moved back to a closed door on the opposite wall.

The Cee team doorway slid open first.

Jaime spun around from the open archway with a smile, leading a single person toward the front of the bench and stopped. The male stood with a smile and swayed back and forth on a pair of flip flops, wearing a set of street clothing, not a tuxedo of pretty colors. His smile showed a set of golden colored circles.

The Vee team doorway slid open next.

Jackie spun around from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of twenty-one people toward the same bench and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and pointed with a sneer at the single young male of the Cee team. Each person wore an elegant evening gown or a tuxedo of orange colors with a pair of green gloves. Each cheekbone showed a set of golden tinted circles.

Jamie and Jackie spun around met in middle with a smile and a nod to each glass screen.

Jackie smiled into the microphone. "Jackie, here. The Vee team is here. My sister Jamie stands behind the Cee team. The Vee team is the other biological family members of the lonely Cee team. Each family member wants a share of the inherited coin account that was left by a mother or a grandmother or aunt or cousin, who died last week. However, the solo Cee team member says no. This is the justification crime for true justice by the other nice citizens of Society City Four. You get twenty seconds for the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Say your peace within twenty seconds. Each one of you are accountable of the guilt including all your immediate family in Zulu Time."

Jaime smiled into the microphone. "Jaime, here. Cee team is on person. You have twenty seconds to voice your justification case. Go!"

Jackie handed the microphone to the middle aged man of the Vee team with a smile and a nod. Her sister Jamie handed the microphone to the young adult male of the Cee team with a smile and a nod. They back stepped away from the bench and the two debating teams, stopping and stood against a small spot on the curved wall between the rows of tiny black glass screens with a smile. Each tiny black screen was six inches long by six inches wide that contained a face of a registered viewer, who owned a com-d or a communication devise to see and hear the world, especially the world of Society City Four.

The twins stared at the nose profile of each team member, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

The first person in the line of twenty-one members of the Vee team, the middle aged female wore an orange ankle-length evening gown with a pair of long elbow gloves of green with a smile. Her face displayed on both cheekbones a set of golden tinted solid circles. "Will, we want this matter to be civilized here inside Zulu Time."

Will, the single member of the Cee team, a young adult male smiled into the microphone without the golden coins noise on twin cheekbones. "I am being civilized. And I am repeating again all this to you and the viewing audience. I am the sole heir to the coin account which was stated inside the Last Will and Testament of my mother, your mother, your grandmother, your aunt, or your cousin."

The third person in the line of twenty-one members of the Cee team moved ahead and stopped, standing in the first line and reach out, grabbing the microphone. The middle aged woman wore an elegant orange gown with a pair of green elbow gloves. Her face showed the same design, a set of golden tinted solid circles on each cheekbone with a smile. "We came here to share and split the money, honey."

Will exhaled. "I am the sole heir as it is stated inside the legal Will. It was documented on the com-d. Everyone saw it. Everyone heard it. Everyone knows it now here inside Zulu Time, too."

The ninth person in the line of twenty-one members of the Vee team moved ahead and reached over, stealing the microphone from the speaker. He was a young teenager, wearing an orange tinted tuxedo with a yellow bowtie and a pair of yellow matching hand gloves. "Dude, you have brought about miscommunication, misinterpretation, and mistake here inside Zulu Time."

Will smirked. "Now, you all will die here inside Zulu Time."

The sixth person in the line of twenty-one members of the Cee team, the young teenager moved ahead and grabbed the microphone, wearing an elegant orange gown with a pair of green elbow gloves. Her face showed the same design, a set of golden tinted solid circles on each cheekbone with a smile. "There is plenty of coin to share with your sister, Will."

Will shook a head of shaggy blonde colored hair with a smile. "Sister dear, you challenged me, the will, and the way, making it possible for all us to be here inside Zulu Time, this afternoon."

The lights went black.

The voices of Jamie and Jackie said with a smile within the darkness in unison. "The twenty second deadline has expired."

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness. "You have heard the justification case. Vote now on your com-d. Vote now on your com-d."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "The voting is done. Illuminate all the glass screens in Zulu Time."

All the tiny glass screens showed a black back ground with one single letter in white.

The voice of Jamie gasped within the darkness, seeing all the illuminated screens. "O dear, Jackie!"

The voice of Jackie gasped within the darkness too, seeing all the illuminated screens. "O dearest, Jamie?"

The voices of Jamie and Jackie both gasped and said within the darkness in unison, "A tie."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "This rarely happens. It is a tie with the same votes of the letter V for the victim team and the letter C for the criminal team."

The voice of Jamie said with a smile within the darkness. "But Zulu Time has a solution."

The voice of Jackie said with a smile within the darkness. "When the mathematical number for both letters of C and V are the same, both the Cee and Vee teams are found guilty of the crime. So both teams will be mounted upon the wall of criminals."

The tiny lights from the millions of glass screens turned black. The dark room echoed in a series of loud screams and harsh curses plus the sounds of soft rips and tears of fabric. Then the room was silent.

A few second later, all the overhead lights illuminated inside the Zulu Time room.

One the forward and both side walls, there were twenty-two objects that were seated in height from tallest down towards shortest, leaning against the wall. Each object was taped in the color of tan bandages, cascading down from the hair roots to the toenails with a set of red tape over the heart region and the complete skull.

Inside the Zulu Time room, Jackie twirled around to see each screen with a smile. "Within the rules of Zulu Time, no one team has won and will not participate in the judgment. Both the Cee and the Vee teams have lost. Now, there are twenty-two members of the losing Vee and Cee teams that have been captured, bandaged, and mounted on the wall in the dull color of tan and the pretty color of red against the forward wall for just and justice of the Vee team. Each Cee and Vee team member can see, feel, hear, and taste their upcoming punishment too. Thus, the Cee and the Vee teams are sentenced to death by means of the fun and creative methods of a Regulator on the wall of criminals."

Jamie swirled around to see each glass screen with a smile. "This part of Zulu Time when there is not a winning team. A row of Regulators will enter the Zulu Time room and discharge one weapon at one wiggling object on the wall of criminals."

Jackie whirled around to see each glass screen with a smile. "And I do believe that our evening audience of viewers is tired of silly games and empty words. Let's take it outta of here, Jamie." She stopped the whirl and dashed toward the open archway with a smile.

Jamie stopped the swirl and dashed toward the other open archway with a smile. "I'm outta of here, Jackie."

A line of golden tinted Regulators entered the Zulu Time room from each archway of the Vee and Cee team doorway, meeting the middle of the long bench, standing in front of one single wiggling object on the forward wall.

The wall of criminals wiggled with a set of flinging limbs of arms and legs and softly moans like a ghost.

Each Regulator lifted and aimed a hand gun, clicking off the safety on each gun.

Jackie and Jaime appeared and stood inside an opposite archway on each side of the Zulu Time room for safety with a smile and a nod in unison. "Aim high..."

Both the doors closed shut and locked down.

Each Regulator aimed a two-fisted hand gun, gritting the teeth, pressing the trigger finger at one object on the wall of criminals. An array of bullets released and fired with red sparks, sailing through the air waves, hitting the skull, the neck, the heart, and other body parts of the twenty-two numerous wiggling objects and as, each wiggling object softly groaned in pain. The array of loud flashing bullets echoed over the soft moans of the wall of criminals.

Finally, each object turned rich black in death and stillness.

The Zulu Time room went black.

The voices of Jackie and Jamie said with a smile in unison within the darkness. "It is done!"

The voices of Jackie said with a smile in unison within the darkness "Please stay tuned to us and Zulu Time."

The voices of Jamie said with a smile in unison within the darkness "There are more dead bodies coming to Zulu Time."

The wall of glass changed into a set of wiggling lines of aqua and rose-pinkish tinted circles of color with a musical song of loud drums and guitars of rock and roll music.

At 11:22 am, inside the Zulu holding pen behind a glass cage interior, Oltole continued to tap on the new com-d with a stern face. "Igala, I don't know what is going to happen in Zulu Time in a few seconds. The Solo concept is rarely used. As a matter of fact, you are the first citizen to employ it here. But remember? You must think with your heart, not your mind. Your mind is filled with past and present thoughts of hate, love, joy, and sorrow. You cannot purge these thoughts or the emotions. So, think with your heart."

"Yeah, it is." I turned with a sour frown to see the nose profile of my granny. "I don't understand. What does that mean, Granny?"

The glass door slide open inside the Smith family glass cage. The Regulator stood outside the empty hallway and droned without a smile or an emotion to see Genic, Henoana, and Oltole. "It is Zulu Time."

I gasped with shock from the rich timber of the Regulator and gathered up the long skirt, slowing turning with a worried brow to see the open archway. I led first through the archway and tripped over the long dress with a soft curse and a big worry flying through the archway and halted, balancing upright again like a future dead girl. The dress was more majestic in rich green tones and extra length, flowing down from the waistline. The dress train was five feet of curved satin. The bodice of the dress was shaped like a sideways square with a bare collar bone. The right side of my collar bone was slightly hidden behind the edge of the tilted square green fabric. The waistline was fitted and looked tiny as the skirt bellowed out and around my legs.

The dress train was most usual and unusually long. The front of the solid green skirt was circular with a set of three crinolines. The three crinolines made the dress hemline float over the floor, sorta. The front of the skirt swept around to the side in a circular pattern and then elongated over into a straight line. The rear of the dress flowed to the side, going out about four more feet.

Yeah, it was pretty. Yeah, it was heavy. Yeah, it was annoying.

I reached down and gathered a handful of dress hemline with a sour frown, jerking the hemline to both kneecaps without exposing the garter belt and switchblade, turning and moved to stand behind the back spine on Jamie.

The Smith family members slowly moved one at a time through the archway and turned, standing behind the back spine on Igala with a set of smiles and soft chuckles.

The archway into the criminal side wall was closed, tossing the entire hallway into darkness.

The Zulu Time hostess named Jaime chanted in unison with her sister Jackie inside a hand-held microphone with a whisper, since the microphone would re-broadcast her voice into a wall of black tinted glass screen inside each home within Society City Four as Jaime stood behind a closed metal door inside the darkness of the Cee criminal area. Her dress didn't spark within the blackness of the hallway. She whispered, "Welcome back to Zulu Time, the place of just and justice!"

Then each face of both girls appeared together on each wall of glass in every home within Society City Four. A new song of classical harp and piano musical notes and an array of colorful pink and gray fireworks flamed over the collar bones of both recorded photographs of Jackie and Jaime within the blazing colorful background.

The wall of glass flashed and showed the Zulu Time room.

The Zulu Time room was fashioned into a backward D-shape into one continuous curvy wall and a long and straight forward wall of tan fabric. The curved wall was colored in tan without an art painting or a viewing window of the trees and the sunlight. The forward wall was long and straight, holding emptiness.

Inside the Cee team hallway, the metal door was closed. I stood behind the back spine on Jaime and rolled my eyeballs and my hands with worry, exhaling with puff of short breathes. I might faint on top of the dirty black carpet, before the door opened. I will enter Zulu Time for the fourth time and must announce out loud the word, solo. Then I will go into the Bowl alone to fight and hope for something good.

The other Smith family members were huddled and cuddled together behind the back spine on Igala, making silly giggles and faces at each other for fun.

The criminal side door slid open along with the victim side door at the same time on a set of two different side walls.

I didn't bother to shade my sensitive eyelashes from the bright lights inside the Zulu Time room, exhaling with a puff of annoyance. The twin sister Jackie inside her open archway signaled in silence a smile and a nod to her sister Jaime.

Jackie was a pale skinned female, exiting from her archway. Jamie was a dark skinned female, exiting from the criminal archway as both females moved across the hard floor at the same time and stopped together in the middle of the room with a smile and a nod. Each female rotated around the room, waving a hand with a bright smile into the hand microphone, saying at the same time in unison, "Jackie and Jaime."

Jackie smiled with a nod into the microphone, wearing the same dress, pair of boots without a pair of gloves, and smeared set of facial designs. "Jackie, here. Zulu Time, a specific place and time for a judge, a jury, and an executioner of justice. The rules, when an injustice occurs, each party is here."

Jamie stood beside her sister Jackie, wearing the same dress, pair of boots without a pair of colorful hand gloves, and smeared set of facial designs. She smiled into the microphone. "Jamie, here. Voice your justification case for twenty seconds. While the rest of the people watch and eat. After twenty seconds, the citizens judge you winner or dead."

Both the doors closed shut.

Each female spun around with a smile and moved back to a closed door on the opposite wall.

Inside the Cee team hallway, the criminal door slid open for a third time.

Jamie approached with a smile and a nod to see Igala and spun away from Igala with the same frozen smile, leading the Igala and the Smith family over the semi-hard flat surface of tan colors into an empty Zulu Time room.

I moved ahead and wrought my naked hands, wishing for a pair of gloves, limping with the switchblade bump and rattled the thick gem stones on the necklace, stopping with a puff of deep worry, without viewing the same old Zulu Time room, which I knew from my ancient memory.

The entire floor was a tan colored semi-hard surface with a wall-to-wall long sitting bench which was covered in tan fabric. The bench rested one-fourth into the depth of the room.

The rest of the Smith family slowly emerged through the archway and stopped a few feet into the Zulu Time room, waving with a hand, blowing a kiss with a hand, and smiling at each tiny glass screen. Three of the walls were curved and displays millions of tiny glass black tinted screens that represented a registered com-d within Society City Four.

I exhaled with a puff of worry, not feeling any movement behind my butthole and turned with a gasp to see my family members.

The other Smith family members stood between the back spine on Igala and the closed entrance door of the Cee team hallway, waving with a hand, blowing a kiss with a mouth, and smiling at each tiny glass screen. Henoana lifted and waved both hands with a smile and a nod. Segue lifted and waved one hand at a time. Genic waved a hand and a smile at each ting glass screen. Laddie twirled around in a tight circle and waved both hands with a grin and a giggle.

Oltole stood in place and slowly turned to stare at each tiny glass screen with a stern face, holding the new com-d between both the naked palms.

I stared with a sour frown at each back spine or face of my family members.

Eventually, the remaining Smith family members slowly twirled and swirled, parking behind the back spine on Igala in front of the low bench of soft beige fabric, still waving and smiling at each glass screen.

I exhaled with a puff of frustration, annoyance and worry, swinging a stern face to see the closed door of the Vee team hallway.

The Vee team hallway door slid open.

Jackie spun away from the open archway with a smile, leading a line of seven people toward the front of the same bench and stopped. Each person stopped behind her back spine and pointed with a sneer at Igala. Each person wore an elegant evening gown or a tuxedo of maroon hue with a pair of silver gloves. Each cheekbone and forehead showed a set of painted lips in the colors of matching maroon hues.

Jamie and Jackie spun around met in middle with a smile and a nod to each glass screen.

Jackie smiled into the microphone, "Jackie, here. The Vee team is here. My sister Jamie stands behind the Cee team. The teen daughter of the Vee team was a victim of a car accident that involved the teen daughter of the Cee team. The teen daughter of the Cee team has turned the age of eighteen years old and cannot pass a re-gen test for a re-gen job due to her injuries from the car accident. This is the justification crime for true justice by the other nice citizens of Society City Four. You get twenty seconds for the justification case. There will not be any type of physical fist fight or body violence allowed here inside Zulu Time, only a series of heated words. Say your peace within twenty seconds. Each one of you are accountable of the guilt including all your immediate family in Zulu Time."

Jaime smiled into the microphone, "Jaime, here. I stand behind the Cee team. You have twenty seconds to voice your justification case. Go!"

Jackie handed the microphone to the seventeen-year-old Lexedo of the Vee team with a smile and a nod. Her sister Jamie handed the microphone to seventeen year Igala of the Cee team with a smile and a nod. They back stepped away from the bench and the two debating teams, stopping and stood against a small spot on the curved wall between the rows of tiny black glass screens with a smile. Each tiny black screen was six inches long by six inches wide that contained a face of a registered viewer, who owned a com-d or a communication devise to see and hear the world, especially the world of Society City Four.

The twins stared at the nose profile of each team member, saying in unison with a smile and a nod. "Begin Zulu Time..."

Lexedo was a short and skinny girl with a head of short brown pixie hair, a tone of bronze skin, and a pair of aqua colored eyeballs, wearing a maroon dress with a pair of silver elbow length gloves and a set of pucker lips on each cheekbone and a forehead in the color of matching maroon hues. The forehead facial design moved and shifted back and forth which formed a pucker kiss symbol and then released back into a wide smile of lips with a smacking sound. She held a microphone with a set of manicured re-designer fake fingernails in the color of black with a sneer, touching the top of her hair roots with the other hand. The rest of her family members were touching the top of the hair and pointed at Igala with confusion. Lexedo pointed at Igala with a frown, "Why are they wearing tiaras and earrings like a set of princes and princesses? We don't recognize a prince or a princess within Society City Four."

I gasped in shock. Lexedo didn't bother to accuse Igala of a crime. I spun around with a gasp to see my family members.

Each member of the Smith family waved with a hand, blew a kiss with a mouth, and smiled into each tiny glass screen, rotating around in a tight circle with a set of giggles or chuckles.

Lexedo yelled into the microphone, "I call Tag Team."

I spun around with a gasp and a pair of parted lips to see Lexedo and all her family members. Lexedo had a very large family of seven people, including an elderly grandmother. I was fighting inside the Bowl alone with a single hand switchblade against six strong and able bodies. I could defeat the grandmother. So Lexedo had thoroughly read through all the rules and regulations of Zulu Time unlike Igala.

Lexedo shifted side to side with a grin and a giggle in silence, staring at Igala.

Jackie lifted both arms and the microphone into the air with a stern face and a serious tone, facing Lexedo without twirling around in a circle to see each glass screen. "Stop, now. Silence, now."

Jamie lifted both arms and the microphone into the air with a stern face and a serious tone, facing Igala without twirling around in a circle to see each glass screen. "The Tag Team has been called by one of the Zulu Time team members."

Jaime pointed at Igala with a stern face and a nod. "The Tag Team call is actually a person substitution mechanism within the Zulu Time rules."

Jackie pointed at Kallidin with a stern face and a nod. "The family unit can substitute another person to fight for them inside the Zulu Time."

Jackie and Jaime said in unison with a smile and a nod. "Except, one original team stays..."

"The Tag Team..." Jaime twirled around in the pretty short dress with a smile to see each glass screen.

"The Tag Team..." Jackie swirled in the opposite direction beside her sister in the pretty dress with a smile to see each glass screen also.

I dropped open a mouth in silence and worry. I was going to face six strong and able teen hunky males which was the exact same similar strategy from dead and buried Kallidin. Ucal and Oltole had told Igala to say out loud the word, solo, inside the Zulu Time room during the justification case, but they had not explained the reason. I couldn't fathom a reason or an answer, until now.

Now, I will die much quicker, hopefully without much pain, while fighting against a wall of six times muscle, strength, and tallness.

Jackie raised both her arms and the microphone into the air with a stern face and a serious tone. "Stop, now. Silence, now."

Jackie turned with a stern face and jabbed a finger with a nod to Lexedo. "Who are the members of your Tag Team?"

I swung around with a gasp to see Lexedo in silence.

Lexedo continued to smile at Igala in silence.

The Vee team door slid opened.

A familiar teen male jogged forward into the Zulu Time room, coming from the darkness of the hallway and stopped, standing beside Lexedo with a smile and a nod to Igala. The rest of her family members silently stood behind the back spine on Lexedo. Lexedo reached out and patted the hand of the tall teen male with a smile in silence, staring at Igala on the other side of the room.

Ethdamn wore a maroon colored tuxedo with a silver bowtie. Both cheekbones possessed a wiggling tongue of matching maroon hues as the facial design. The forehead showed a set of lips with an exposed tongue. The tongue wiggled side to side with a soft chuckle of annoyance for any eardrums.

I gasped with shock then gagged on my mouth spit and then coughed out loud, lifting the microphone to the lips with a meek timber. "Solo..."

Jackie turned and gasped at Igala. "Pardon me!"

Jamie turned and gasped at Igala. "Pardon me, too!"

I exhaled with a meek timber into the microphone. "I call out, solo."
Jackie turned with a worried brow to see the Vee team and back to see Igala. "Are you positively sure, young girl of the Cee team?"

Jaime turned with a worried brow to see the Vee team and back to see Igala. "Are you absolutely certain, young lady of the Cee team?"

I slowly turned with a puff of worry to see a closed metal door of the Cee team entrance hallway, wishing for a miracle that didn't come. The door was still closed and shut on the side of the wall for the Cee team entrance. Then my eyelashes focused on each family member.

The other members of the Smith family slowed turned in a tight circle with a hand wave and a pretend mouth kiss to see each glass screen, producing a set of giggles and soft chuckles with fun amusement.

I swung around with a stern face to see Jamie. "Solo..."

Jackie and Jaime stared with an open mouth at Igala and said in unison. "Zulu Time has ended."

The lights went black.

Both doors slid open. A group of Regulators entered through each archway, reaching and dragging off the non-fighting family members of each Cee teams which included Genic, Henoana, Oltole, Segue, and Laddie off the floor of Zulu Time and back through the archway, herding them into a huddle, moving through the archway. The missing Vee team member was the elderly grandmother, who slowly turned and left the Zulu Time room.

I spun around with a worried brow to see a blob of dark blackish green colored bodies that represented my biological family unit.

The Cee team door slid closed.

Each member of the Smith family had left the Zulu Time room without planting a wet kiss on the cheekbone of Igala. Then the rest of the Smith family will leave the Zulu Time building and will ride back inside a smooth airship limousine with a set of smiles and laugher, heading back to the house while watching the Zulu Time action on the small black tinted glass screen inside the leather seat like the previous four times.

A few second later, all the overhead lights illuminated again.

I swung around with a gasp to see the Vee team. The Vee team consisted of Lexedo, her family members, missing the grandmother, and the new tall teen male Ethdamn, who all stared back at Igala. I whispered with a worried heart for my eardrums only to the closed door. "I love you, Mom, Dad, Laddie, Segue, and Granny." I exhaled with a puff of worry and held back the tears of fear.

The lights went black.

I gathered the front of the dress into a ball and slowly turned with a worried brow, moving toward the open archway.

At 11:30 am, Ucal waited inside the Cee team hallway on top of the bloody black stained carpet and beside the first glass cage with a smile for Igala.

The Zulu Time hostesses Jamie and Jackie had exited from the Zulu Time room first and then moved back into a shared dressing room for a powder of fresh makeup and a set of bodily functions, before re-entering back into the Zulu Time room for more Zulu Time candidates during the late afternoon.

So far, the entire morning and part of the early afternoon had been filled with a series of violent riots and volumes of more violent protestor persons outside the Zulu Time campus and inside the popular social places within Society City Four. Protesting was not against the law, but a protestor of destroyed piece of public property or a human physical punch was against the law.

The Zulu Time room had been busy with set of numerous groups of both victims and criminals. And it was not over for the day, either.

All the glass cages were all empty of families of criminals at the moment. So far, it had been a bad day for all the criminals. Each one was dead and prepped to be buried inside the white marble tomb. Igala and her family were the last Zulu Time criminals for the mid-afternoon. Now, the entire audience was waiting and watching to see the fight inside the Bowl.

Inside the Zulu Time room, I slowly turned from the bench and wiped the tears from a face. I was going into the Bowl arena alone, since I had shouted out and proclaimed the word, solo.

Solo was defined as one person. The person was Igala. My grandmother Oltole had read all the Zulu Time rules. And then she left the switchblade on top of the pretty emerald evening gown.

I didn't understand. Yes, I did understand with my mind, not my heart.

My heart only opined for a warm hug and a hot kiss from my boyfriend Dfee. I wanted to leave and get married, right now, today. Instead, I was going back into the Bowl for the fourth and final time. There were not any more girlfriends inside the old ancient Cadillac rolling vehicle as I was driving around the Hall campus for fun. Then I hit the parked hover car on the roadside. The rest of my schoolers fiends...friends were dead, resting inside a cold tomb in the Vee Building on the Zulu Time campus.

I exhaled with a puff of wonderment. I wondered if death hurts, when you die. I moved through the open archway, looking down for some blood stains over the black carpet and ran into a wall of muscle.

A few feet from the open archway, Ucal wrapped both arms around Igala with a chuckle and a smile, "Gorgeous, funny meeting you here in this strange and usually creepy place."

I looked up with a gasp. "You need to go."

Ucal smiled with a nod. "We need to go. Yes, we do." He swung around to face the opposite wall and cuddled Igala with a chuckle, swiftly moving them toward a solid wall of light beige paint between the glass cages on top of the black carpet of fresh and dried blood stains with a grin.

I gasped. "What's happening? Where are we going? I must report inside the Bowl now for my participating in Zulu Time. Or...or my family will die..."

"Naw, your family is safe. They're entering the limousine, now. We're going to medical ward."

I gasped. "I'm not sick."

"You are very healthy. I'm very pleased. You can wait inside the medical ward..."

"Wait for what?" I gasped with puzzlement. "I'm needed to attend the Bowl arena, now."

He cuddled with her with a smile. "Naw, you got some time."

I exhaled. "I want to be alone before my time comes."

He smiled. "Naw, I wanna be with you with our time together."

"Where are we going? The exit hallway into the wooden floor and down to the Cee rooms is parallel to my collar bone."

He pointed with a smile to the solid wall ahead. "The medical ward is through that door."

I turned with a confused brow to see a solid wall. "What door? I see a solid wall of beige paint."

They stopped and stood in front of a solid wall that was the height of the room and the width of a dining room chair with a pair of arm rests. He smiled. "This is the hidden entrance into the medical ward."

I searched the solid wall for a seam with a sigh of annoyance. "Why is it hidden?"

He reached up and slapped the metal door with a smile. The door slid open. He entered and dragged Igala into the small elevator carriage without spinning around to face the hallway of Zulu Time. The doors closed automatically behind both back spines as it sensed the body heat of the two individual humans.

The elevator carriage lifted to the next level and stopped.

A single metal door remained closed behind both the two back spines.

Ucal spun around with Igala and reached out with a smile, slamming the door.

The new door opened.

11:35 am

Zulu Time Building

Medical ward setting

The room was small in the shape of a narrow rectangle with rows of chairs against two walls. The forward wall held a set of individual windows. One of the side walls displayed a wall of glass to view an entertainment program.

Ucal entered through the archway and cuddled Igala with a smile, stopping, standing in place with a grin. "This is the Zulu Time medical ward. You visited here during your second Zulu Time and after the first Bowl participation. No one comes in here but the medically needed like an injured but alive person. You'll be safe here. My mom and the other Regulators are posted inside the hallway of Zulu Time."

I stopped and stood inside his warm hug with a gasp. "Yes, I remember, sorta." I pulled away from his hug and dashed ahead, stopping and stood in front of one of the clear window with a gasp and a puzzled brow. "This is the Zulu Time room."

He moved ahead and stopped, standing and cuddled Igala with a smile. "Sorta, the medical ward is over the Zulu Time room, in case of an emergency or something."

"No one survives among the dead."

"It is for Jamie or Jackie, in case one of them gets hurt..."

"...like tripping over a re-designer heel." I sneered.

"What?" He continued to fiddle the com-d with a smile.

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance, "Nothing." I reached out and touched the glass. "I didn't know this medical ward place existed. I thought all the tiny glass screens were each a registered com-d."

He looked up with a smile to see inside the Zulu Time room. "All the glass screens represent a purchased com-d, even the illegal ones. The window view here is magnified inside the room for better viewing. I see that Twaddle, 'the waddle' will finally get his due day within Zulu Time."

I gasped with worry. "I see Mr. Twaddle down on the floor of Zulu Time." A middle aged male stood near the doorway with a set of twin bald spots over each eyebrow and a pot belly of good food around a thick middle stood beside the low and long sitting bench of tan colors alone. I couldn't hear the music or the words inside the Zulu Time room, but I saw the people with a gasp. "Why would Mr. Twaddle want to come inside the Zulu Time room? Why would anyone want to come into Zulu Time room?" I exhaled with a puff of horrible memories that my brain cells would not purge for decades.

Ucal stared down into the Zulu Time room with a laugh. "He hated his creative nickname Twaddle, the waddle, a used and abused childish sarcasm from each teen that he had taught at Hall for many decades. A re-generator teacher has a tough job with a set of wild smarthole teens within Society City Four. So, he finally got the guts to accuse one of the sassy teens of verbal abuse."

"Why would Mr. Twaddle do that?"

"I would say that he's mentally abused which has landed his button hole and the selected annoying teen inside Zulu Time."

"Who are going to vote for?"

Ucal tapped on the com-d wrist watch with a laugh, "Our schooler mate Keer, of course! Twatter will finally get his due and his award, death on the wall with a memory of twaddle and wattle inside Hall, tomorrow. I plan to help Keer with the job."

I exhaled with a puff of frustration and watched the figures down on the Zulu Time floor. "This is never going to stop, is it? No one is going to stop it. The regulators can't. The citizens want. I'm sick of living a lie."

He side stepped and cuddled her with a smile and a whisper into her cheekbone. "You are correct. Zulu Time will never stop or cease or die. The Regulators will continue to exist and support just and justice, sorta.

I stared down at the two lines of Zulu Time attendees. One was the family of Keer and the other was the only abused mentally sick man of middle aged Twaddle. I whispered. "I..."

"Igala, I have something to tell you."

I exhaled with bravery. "I know. I'm going back into Zulu Time alone."

"No, you are not going back into Zulu Time. And I wanna ask you something, gorgeous."

"Ask me what?"

Ucal smiled. "Igala, I love you. I always cared about you, since we were little tikes living next door at my grandmother's house. And now, with everything that we have been through as a couple, I want you as my partner for the rest of my life."

"Ucal, I have something to tell you, also." I smiled with the truth, too.

He nodded with a smile. "We are young teens, who think the same way, the righteous way. We will join the Regulators against the rebellion, the fight for right and justice, Igala."

I gasped with a whisper for my eardrums only. "My grandmother said exactly that, too."

"You are dead."

I gasped. "What the heck? I'm not dead. I live. I breathe."

He nodded with a stern face. "You and I have been labeled as a pair of criminals that will fight inside Zulu Time again."

I shook my curls with a confused brow. "No. You survived Zulu Time. I saw Kallidin's tomb inside the Vee Building. She died. She died inside Zulu Time. You killed her. Therefore, you won Zulu Time. Thus, we are both finally free of Zulu Time."

Ucal exhaled. "The citizens attacked the Bowl arena, killing us. I am dead, Igala."

I gasped. "You are dead, but you are here with me."

He nodded with a stern face. "You are dead. I am dead."

I gasped and turned to see the action down inside the Zulu Time room with a meek voice of sobs. "I can't do that, again. I can't. I can't go into Zulu Time or the Bowl another time. I just can't."

He whispered with a smile. "You won't. I'm going to become a Regulator. I'm going to join the rebellion. I'm going to enforce laws that no other innocent will die in Zulu Time. And you can join me, too. A Regulator is disguised. No one will recognize you, ever. We can be a part of this new movement, together serving peace throughout Society City Four."

I exhaled. "I'm going to marry Dfee. He has re-gen job in food. We're going to live in the country away from Zulu Time. I don't need the protective disguise of a robot."

He turned with a sigh to see the action on the Zulu Time floor. "Dfee is in Zulu Time."

I turned and gasped to see his hair roots. "Then, you get him released from Zulu Time. You say this is the last one. There will be no more Zulu Time ever."

He stared down at the action on the Zulu Time floor with a stern face and mixed emotions. "I can't get him out. I am so sorry. The Regulator accepted the claim. Dfee is a criminal. I cannot do anything to stop the event." He looked up and turned with a stern face to see Igala. "We cannot do anything. Zulu Time begins very soon."

I gasped and stomped a sandal with a stern face in fury. "Release him, now!"

"Dfee will fight inside the Bowl. He's strong. He'll survive, Igala. I truly believe that. Then, Dfee will win Zulu Time. He will finally be free of Zulu Time. Then Dfee can live in the countryside..."

"...with me." I gritted my teeth with a nod. "Our problem is completely solved. I don't like that Dfee has to fight and kill for his freedom. But he will survive."

He looked up and turned with a sad face and a nod to see Igala. "Dfee will win Zulu Time to be and do whatever he pleases. You will be recognized as soon as you remove the raccoon-eyes, gorgeous. Then, all the citizens will demand that you be placed right back inside Zulu Time to fight as a criminal, too."

I gasped, "For what crime? I'm not a criminal. I didn't hit another car."

"Lexedo family had filed an automobile claim on you like the family of Kallidin before and then the family of Minki, previously. Zulu Time has turned into a blood-letting, not a volley of justice for an innocent soul."

I growled. "Don't worry! Dfee will kill them all for me."

He exhaled. "Look, Igala. I would do anything for you and Dfee."

I back stepped and crossed both arms with a sneer and a nod at Ucal. "You invite Dfee to join the Regulators. Then, I will join, too."

He smiled with a nod. "I planned to be that, too. I just want you to understand what we all face in our future here within Society City Four."

I dropped both arms and slapped the emerald green evening gown and moved forward, leaning over and hugged Ucal with a whisper. "I completely understand, now. Thank you. And I want you to understand, Ucal." I pulled back with a stern face and a nod. "I love Dfee. Then, we all will become a batch of golden Regulators, together. But I will marry Dfee. But I still love you, too."

He exhaled with a puff of disappointment with a smile. "The 'bestest' man won, gorgeous."

I nodded with a smile. "Dfee is the 'bestest' man."

"Dwit, Dfee, Dfun." He laughed with a nod. "That is why he's my best friend, too."

I smiled with a nod. The overhead lights went dark inside the Zulu Time room, indicating it was time to vote for the winner. "He's cute and funny."

He lifted and punched on the com-d with a vote for his schooler friend Keer with a smile. "I'm too cute and too serious." He looked up with a smile to her. "I really do love you, but he is the best choice." He turned with a worried brow to see the closed door. "I need to go and must arrange a limousine ride for our escape."

I turned and stared down with a worried brow inside the Zulu Time room. There was one lonely figure on the wall of criminals, the re-gen teacher Mr. Twaddle. The line of Keer and his family were silently battling over the individual weapons to kill the mentally sick man. I exhaled. "Why?"

"The gangs of protestors are wrecking all the flying vehicles and destroying the ugly street pavement for transportation. I must go and get a limousine and do..."

I turned and gasped into his nose profile, "Dfee?"

He returned back with a smile and a nod to see Igala. "I'm going to get the body...boy, now. Stay here and don't move. Okay?"

I nodded with a smile and fidgeted with my fingers. "Yeah, okay, I'm staying put. Come back soonest. I'm uncomfortable here."

He leaned over and kissed her cheekbone, pulling back with a smile and a nod, back stepping from the window. He turned and moved to the closed door of the elevators with a grin, stopping and leaned down, pressing the button. The door opened. He entered the carriage with a smile.

The elevator door closed.

11:40 am

Cee Team entrance tunnel

Steel gate setting

Inside the empty tunnel of darkness for the Cee team, Ucal moved ahead through the corridor and shouted with a worried brow, "Dfee!" He dashed ahead and slammed into the chest of Dfee, hugging his childhood friend with a grin.

Dfee pulled back with a smile and slapped the collar bone of Ucal, "Ucal, I'm glad to see you alive, one more time, man."

Ucal winked. "That's our little secret, right, bro?"

He smiled. "Then, I take it that you ain't going to help me beat some button-holes, tonight."

"No, not this round, buddy!"

Dfee frowned. "And you didn't kill Kallidin inside the Bowl of Zulu Time." Ucal shook a skull. Dfee frowned. "You didn't. So, if you didn't kill Kallidin, then who did?"

Ucal turned and frowned at the steel gates that led into the Bowl arena, looking back to see Dfee. "The citizens, they invaded Zulu Time and then attacked and killed the rest of the horses and us. I hit the ground like a pot of spilled chicken stew. The brilliant idea saved my button-hole," laughing.

Dfee turned and frowned at the steel gates and back to see Ucal, "What about the citizens here in Society Number Four?"

He nodded with a stern face. "They obsess with Zulu Time. They crave Zulu Time. They bleed Zulu Time, only it's not their bloody veins."

Dfee nodded with a stern face. "That's why I'm being tossed back into the Bowl arena during Zulu Time. The family of Lexedo has claimed the finally dang thing on Igala for the last time. I don't understand any of this. This isn't the way that Zulu Time works."

"Right, bro," he smiled with a nod. "And I'm here to bail your button-hole out of Zulu Time."

"You're dead." Dfee frowned. "Based on the current hot gossip..."

"You can be, too, Dfee. I'm joining Society becoming a Regulator, right now, today. I'm eighteen years old like you. All of the Regulators are going to implement a new law and work against all the Zulu Time rules."

"The robots!" Dfee frowned.

"The Regulators will be the new law like a group of police officers during the ancient days that were long ago."

"The citizens will riot."

He shook a skull with a sour frown. "The citizens are rioting for their personal selfish greed and vanity of someone else's blood."

Dfee chuckled. "I see clearly your non-bloody point."

"Join me, now, bro! We can start a rebellion together. Society City Four will be bigger and better than before with you and me, a permanent part of it." He reached out and slapped the arm of Dfee with a smile and a nod. "Like, when we were kids taming the crazy squirrels in your backyard."

"When didn't tame the dang squirrels, we shot the squirrels and then ate the meat and used their tails for decoration on our cowboy hats."

He laughed with a smile. "About the same thing, but this time, it ain't squirrel tails, its cheeky button-holes."

Dfee frowned. "No, I don't wanna be a glowing coppery bald-headed space man." He smiled with a nod. "I'm going to marry Igala, once I kick me some fine redneck button holes for the last time," chuckling.

"Igala loves you," he nodded with a smile. "She told me about six hundred times after I kidnapped her from the Zulu Time room and escaped from the Regulators, protecting her."

Dfee gasped. "Why would you do that? Why did you do that?"

"The Regulators would have taken her like they had taken you inside the Zulu Time dance. She would be here inside the Bowl, too."

Dfee nodded with a smile. "Thanks. Thanks, you saved her life for me."

He turned and frowned at the steel gates and back to see Dfee. "Dfee, I don't know if you will survive the Bowl competition. I can't play Tag with you, this time. I'm dead. And the Regulator has allowed the claim. You're a criminal for escaping the Bowl arena. I, my golden tinted parents, or another sympatric Regulator can't interfere with the Zulu Time event, tonight."

"I'll survive. Why not? Seven against one, those are pretty good redneck odds." Dfee chuckled.

He frowned. "Igala, she can't survive against those odds of seven strong and tall adults against one girl and a super hero, either."

Dfee frowned. "Explain, bro?"

"Igala is dead, too."

"O man." He looked down with a worried brow to see the unpolished boot toes.

"The Regulator..."

Dfee looked up with a sneer to see Ucal, "Your mama..."

"Yeah, my parents arranged..."

Dfee gasped. "The cavern, there was a cave-in inside Society City Five. I got out in time."

He smiled. "And you escaped with our life..."

Dfee sneered. "You tried to kill me. I'm your best friend."

He smirked, "Naw, bro. There are always cave-ins all the time inside an underground cave. The blast damaged the rear of our limousine. Then, we had to return back to Zulu Time, too early. Then, we didn't get to escape with the plan. Then, Igala was caught and entrapped here into Zulu Time for a third time. Then, the Regulators could not halt the claim by the fourth girl inside the old and ancient rolling automobile that belonged to Igala."

Dfee exhaled. "I understand, too late. You fibbed to all her family members about her upcoming death."

He nodded with a stern face, "Because Igala can't show her pretty face inside Society City Four, anymore or anywhere. Every citizen recognizes her, knows her name, follows her spiked heels, and won't leave her alone ever, never."

Dfee gritted the teeth with a sneer. "I know that. You know that. She doesn't know that. So, I'll happily take Igala away from it all here within Society City Four. I have a re-gen job which is away from here this madness and in the countryside. We live in peace and harmless and away from his horse crap show."

He gasped with worry. "Where will she get a re-gen job? Where will her child go to Hall? How long can you protect her and your children, Dfee?"

Dfee smiled. "What does Igala say?"

"The decision was hard for Igala."

Dfee gasped. "What does she desire?"

"Igala loves you."

Dfee exhaled. "What does she want?"

"Igala wants to live and breathe within Society City Four. Igala has agreed to become a Regulator like me. She doesn't want to die for anyone."

Dfee nodded with a stern face. "I don't blame her. I understand her. I don't wanna die for anyone, either."

"The only way to save her is for Igala to become a Regulator. You know that, Dfee. No one will recognize her behind the tone of golden tinted skin and a pair of silver tinted sunglasses. You know that, too. She will live a full and joyful life without harm and harassment. You know that, also. And she has seen the destruction of Zulu Time on an innocent life. She wants to help and re-mold Society City Four and empower the Regulators to fight back for the innocent with me."

Dfee chuckled. "Mrs. Glow-in-the-dark-coppery bald-head space woman, to boot."

He shook both biceps of Dfee with a stern face. "Dfee, please, come and join us and become a Regulator, too."

"I can't." Dfee chuckled. "I can't believe this. You did all this to steal my girl, man."

He frowned. "Dfee, I'm doing all this to save me, her, and you, buddy."

Dfee turned and stared at the pair of rusty steel encased closed doors that led into the Bowl arena with a stern face. "No, I will not live like a robot." He turned and faked a smile at Ucal. "I'll take my chance inside the Bowl, the last one. I'll bring the house down, bro."

"And die for what?"

Dfee nodded with a stern face. "I will die happy, my way, knowing that Igala is happy, her way. And your way is protecting and loving her. Congratulations, the best man won!" He extended a hand.

He didn't shake the extended hand and reached behind the back spine, grabbing the items with a sour frown, lifting them near a smile, "A one-dimensional happy fool, I brought you a goodbye present. I didn't know if you wanted the sword or the hatchet."

"I'll take both." Dfee reached out and grabbed both weapons with a laugh and a smile.

"Good luck, Dfee." Ucal smiled.

Dfee smiled. "Good blessings, Ucal. Tell Igala that I love her." He shook a skull. "No. Tell Igala! I want her to save me a dance at your golden tinted wedding reception, tonight."

He doesn't smile, "Shore, bro."

The speaker blasted the words. "Brood of vipers, you are condemned to Zulu Time."

Dfee shook a skull with a sneer. "I really hate that phrase."

Ucal exhaled with a puff of sadness and leaned over, giving a final hug to his childhood friend pulling back in silence with a nod. He back stepped and spun around with a smile, dashing back down the dark hallway of the Cee Building for the last time back to his love Igala.

11:55 am

Zulu Time Building

Medical ward location

Reception room setting

Ucal had left Igala alone inside the medical ward room and under the care of his most trust Regulators, dashing ahead to find Dfee. Then, they would all leave the Zulu Time campus for the last time.

I continued to sit inside the narrow rectangle of three walls and a wall of elevators in front of a blank and non-powered wall of glass inside the oversized chair with a worried brow but a happy heart, fiddling with the long evening gown with a giggle. This will be the end of my Zulu Time days and the beautiful re-designers gown. I had accumulated a small re-designer collection. Maybe, I will sale them and make some extra money for my small and short wedding ceremony to Dfee that will last for the rest of my life time.

The wall of glass blinked into life.

I looked up to see the movement and heard the music with a gasp, standing upright, moving to the wall of glass and stopped with intrigue.

The carriage door of the elevator slid open.

Ucal entered the room with a smile and stopped, cuddling with Igala with a nod in front of the wall of glass. "That was quick."

On the wall of glass, Jackie and Jamie sat behind a peach colored counter with a clear glass pitch of water and a set of two individual glass tumblers between the two matching oversized sitting chairs. Jamie smiled into the wall of glass. "Tonight, we have a very usual Bowl event. The Vee team consists of seven members."

Jackie giggled with a smile. "Seven is a lucky, ducky number, Jamie."

She smiled into the glass. "The Cee team consists of one member. One is alone and lonely, Jamie."  
Jackie smiled into the glass. "So, it is one person against seven other people, not good odds."

She smiled into the glass. "The Cee team was allowed a choice of environment. Ironically, the red mud will be disguising all the red blood, coming from the solo Cee team member. O well!"

Jackie smiled into the glass. "O yeah. Zulu Time will offer a set of bonus points for each vector. In mathematics, a vector is represented by the size and the direction of a straight line. If the schooler calculates the direct line from the kill weapon toward the body wound within three percentage points of the proper vector, then Zulu Time will reward points toward your Hall participation at the age of seventeen-year-old."

She smiled with a nod into the glass. "Now, let us watch the exciting bloody action inside the puddles red mud."

On the wall of glass, the two steel gates parted and opened. On top of the Vee team platform, seven individuals moved across the platform and stopped, turning and scanning the new environment.

Inside the reception room of the medical ward, I frowned. "Why did the Cee team select the element of red slimy mud?"

He pointed with a laugh at the wall of glass. "Look at Lexedo, the dumb goddess?"

I gasped with confusion. "What is she doing inside the Bowl ring?"

"Standing there..."

I gasped. "Who is she fighting with? I'm here hiding out inside the medical ward. So, then her family will win the Bowl by default. Is that how it works?"

He frowned at the wall of glass. "No, it does not work like that."

I gasped. "Who is she fighting against? Is it my family?"

"No, it is not your family."

"O. That's good." I frowned at Lexedo. "Her outfit is a shiny silver metallic cat suit with a pair of matching her thigh-boots, a nice fashion statement."

He laughed, "A stupid fashion choice, she's going to slip and slide inside the slick mud. She should be wearing a pair of sturdy cowboy boots which are good in rain, snow, ice and mud, babe. Hmm, I have seen that cat suit before."

I frowned. "Where? She never wore it at Hall during class."

"Hmm, I saw it before."

I back stepped with a gasp and turned to see his nose profile, "You and her?"

"For fun, I saw it before."

"How did you know that she would wear that silver tinted cat suit with the pair of matching silver tinted boots here inside Bowl? And when did she change into her new clothes? Inside the Zulu Time room, she wore a long dress of maroon tones sorta like me. I thought that the Tag Team wasn't allowed to meet and form a strategy."

"The Tag Team can't. She wore the cat suit underneath the long dress and then dumped the dresses inside the Vee team hallway. Hmm. I think I suggested the cat suit..."

I tossed both arms in the air and back down to the dress with a gasp. "You're a cheat. You're a traitor."

"Now, gorgeous, I worked, watched, and waited for you."

"What?"

He nodded with a smile. "During the sissy Tour of Zulu Time, while I was finishing my Hall stuff, Lexedo told me to spy on you. So I pretended to spy on you. Then, I collected all her secrets instead."

I gasped. "You knew about her staking a claim with the Regulator for me to appear inside Zulu Time the entire time. How did you know, Ucal?" I tossed both arms into the air with a gasp. "You have been spying on Lexedo and Kallidin and me. You have cheated at Zulu Time."

He turned and sneered at the wall of glass, seeing his foes Lexedo and her boyfriend Ethdamn. "Zulu Time is a cheat of every life when any person comes in here. I'm sick of this madness and want to become a Regulator, now."

I gasped with realization. "The Tour of Zulu Time, it was your visitation to each Society City. Wasn't it?"

"I..."

I stomped my sandal with a gasp. "It was. I am so dumb. Dfee did..."

He turned and growled at her. "What did Dfee do?"

I exhaled. "You and I have toured the major Society Cities to become...become..."

He smiled. "Yes, we will marry and become a great Regulator team."

I gasped. "What about Dfee? I wanna...worry about Dfee."

He frowned. "Dfee has decided his own fate." Ucal turned and pointed at the wall of glass with a stern face.

I slowly turned with a gasp to the same wall of glass.

Inside the Bowl event, the set of steel gates opened up to show the Cee team. Dfee emerged alone and moved ahead over the platform with a sneer and held a sword and a hatchet.

Inside the reception room of the medical ward, I gasped and moved closer to the glass wall with a worried brow like I could reach out and slap the face of Dfee with a gasp. "No. He rejected your offer to join the Regulators, stupid one-dimensional fool."

On the wall of glass, inside the Bowl arena of Zulu Time, Dfee did not bother to wait on the gong sound, leaping down from the concrete platform of the Cee team, rolling over and into the soft red mud. He painted the body in disguise and stood upright, holding a weapon in each hand. He dashed ahead and hid inside a grove of tall green trees.

On top of the Vee team platform, three of her family members leaped down onto the dirt, running and slammed into the grove of trees and Dfee. Dfee rolled over the mud and stood upright with a sneer, kicking, punching and slicing the two weapons at two brothers and the middle aged father of Lexedo.

Inside the medical ward reception room, I gasped with horror. "Help him, now!"

He reached out and grabbed her arm, pulling Igala into his chest with a sad face. "I can't."

I cuddled into Ucal and stared at the wall of glass. "You can."

He exhaled. "I cannot. Dfee is a criminal. He escaped from the Bowl arena before the thirty-minute time limit which is against the Zulu Time rule."

I sobbed with a sad face. "I escaped with Dfee from the Bowl arena, too."

He exhaled. "If Dfee happens to survive after this Bowl competition, he will be challenged by another citizen as a new criminal. Then, he will be right back into a second Bowl competition. He has chosen wisely."

I jerked away and spun around with a stern face to see Ucal. "No, he has chosen stupidly. And I have chosen stupidly, too. I should be in there with Dfee, helping to save his life."

He exhaled with a soft timber. "Do you really want to die, Igala?"

I exhaled with a soft timber. "No..."

He exhaled with a huff of relief. "I'm glad. You are dead, too. You died inside the Bowl arena, today, this afternoon with Dfee. Thus, Society City Four cannot order you back into the Zulu Time every again."

"What? Why?"

"You called out the word, solo, inside the Zulu Time room, a few minutes ago."

"I did."

"Every pair of eyeballs saw you in person inside Zulu Time. Every pair of eardrums heard you in person inside Zulu Time. Now, you will become a Regulator like me. Then, all of this will be over with shortly. Then, we will be married and happy for the rest of our days."

I turned with sobs of tears to see the wall of glass. Dfee was hiding and waiting for the next Vee team member. "Dfee is going to die."

"For you..."

I turned and gasped at Ucal. "For me, what does that mean? He's going to die for me. Then, do something to help Dfee?"

"I can't, gorgeous. I begged Igala. I begged Dfee to join us as a Regulator. He's so stubborn, his way."

I pulled back with a gasp. "I wanna talk to him."

Ucal leaned over and cuddled her with a sad frown. "You can't, gorgeous. Zulu Time has started. You'll be exposed first and then killed second. We can't help Dfee. He made his decision. No one is more sadder than I. He's my childhood friend. Do you believe me, Igala?"

"I believe you." I turned with tears and stared at the wall of glass.

Inside the Bowl event, on top of the Vee team platform, there were three female relatives of Lexedo family that had remained to watch the action and wait for Dfee. Dfee was alone, fighting for his life inside the Bowl arena.

Ucal leaned over and hugged Igala, watching the action on the wall of glass.

I whispered with a puff of fear. "Why didn't you grant Dfee and his family unit equal status to me and my family, Ucal? I'm a criminal, too. My family members are criminals, also. It's not fair to Dfee and his...."

"The citizens, these protesters outside the Zulu Time Building with the guns and the knives have claimed and executed and killed the entire biological family of Dfee."

I pulled back with a sour frown and a sneer. "I don't believe you. When did this happen?"

He reached over and grabbed her arm with a sneer, spinning around and dashed through the medical ward space, stopping and stood in front of a wall of semi-dark windows. He released her arm and pointed to the black tinted glass with a stern face. "Look out the window! It happened to his family, this morning."

I moved ahead and leaned against the window pane, feeling the hot temperatures on the glass, seeing each skull on top of a pole pike. Each dead human skull displayed blonde colored hair, two baby blue eyeballs, an open mouth of terror, and a set of exposed earlobes. Each human skull represented the baby sister and both the biological parents of Dfee. The mode of angry citizens of Society City Four had hunted down and killed his family in cold blood, since Dfee had escaped from Zulu Time as a criminal of Society City Four. I back stepped from the window and turned with a set of sobs and tears of sadness to see Ucal. "Dfee, he doesn't have a chance. He will die."

He moved ahead and cuddled Igala, spinning around in silence, moving back into the reception room. They stopped and stood in place, watching the wall of glass and the fight of Dfee and the Vee team members.

On the wall of glass inside the Bowl ring, Dfee wore a set of blood and torn clothes. The hunting knife sliced down and stuck into the tree bark, missing Dfee. The Vee team member sneered and leaned down to retrieve the knife.

Dfee slid to the side with a chuckle and a grin. Then, a short black colored club hit and slammed down into the collar bone of Dfee. He stumbled forward and hit the tree, blooding a nose bridge, standing upright and scooted around the tree with a yell.

Inside the reception room of the medical ward, I stumbled forward with a gasp and hit the wall of glass with a set of tears, "Dfee, Dfee..."

Ucal exhaled with a sour frown and moved toward the back spine on Igala. "Dfee has accepted his fate."

"I don't accept that fate or my fate." I spun around and shoved Ucal toward the rear wall with a sneer.

He tumbled backward into the opposite wall and landed inside the row of chairs with a gasp and a worried brow. "You will be killed inside the Bowl, Igala. I promise that."

"I know." I spun around with a stern face and dashed toward the open carriage, entering to face the wall, slapping the button with a worried heart.

Ucal gasped with worry. "Please, stay with me. Please, be with me, Igala. Igala?" He yelled with worry and extreme fear. "No..."

The elevator door slid closed.

At 12:02 pm, the elevator door slid open.

I stood upright inside an empty carriage with a gasp and stared at each glass cage. Each cage was full of citizens.

Some of the loose and free citizens were fighting with a group of Regulators inside the Cee team hallway of the Zulu Time Building.

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance and gathered the elegant dress train, moving ahead, scooting around the fighters, shoving both the other elbows and the other unfamiliar skulls from my fury and dashed through the open archway of the Cee Building. I ran down the familiar wooden floor, knowing the direction of the Bowl arena, praying for a miracle or two.

At 12:04 pm, inside the medical ward reception room, Ucal stood upright from the row of chairs and ran forward with a stern face, slamming into the elevator doors of steel, pressing the button, nervously shifting side to side with worry. This was the only entrance and exit from the medical ward room, since the Regulators knew the sealed seam and the secret room.

The empty elevator carriage lifted up from the ground floor and stopped at the first level. The doors slid opened.

He entered the carriage and slapped the button, hoping to catch up with Igala before she reached the set of closed steel gates at the Cee team platform.

The door slid closed. The carriage shifted downward and landed inside the hallway.

At 12:06 pm, the door slid opened.

Ucal didn't move from the carriage floor but gasped in shock. The entire hallway was filled with gangs of screaming and fighting protestors. All the loose and free protesters were fighting with all the teams of Regulators.

A pair of Regulators was trying to drag and haul a single protester into the Zulu Time room or a set of glass cages.

Ucal advanced ahead from the carriage with a sneer and shoved numerous heated bodies away from an angry face, dashing through the archway of the Cee Building.

"Ucal..." the voice yelled from the parallel hallway of darkness.

Ucal skidded to a halt from the voice of his mom over the wooden floor between the Regulator office and the dance hall with a sissy whine. "I'm helping her."

She stood in place with a sigh. "Ucal, please stay." Her son turned with a sneer and marched to her face with a growl, stopping with a snarl over the golden hair roots of his mom. She would not be intimidated by her son. "I order you to stay, my son." A set of eight Regulators jogged around and surrounded Ucal inside the Regulator hallway in silence.

He exhaled with a defeat. "Help her! She's my life."

She nodded without a smile into his worried face. "There is twenty-three minutes of time left inside the Bowl arena. Then, I will."

At 12:30 pm, I exited from the dark hallway inside the Cee Building and turned the wall corner, running forward, slamming into the closed set of steel doors into the Bowl with a grunt.

I lifted up and pounded the steel with both fists, gritting my teeth, back stepping from the door with a hiss, looking up to find the illuminated glass screen, tossing both arms with a shout of angry at the hidden cameras. "You can see me. I can see you. Open the dang doors, now!"

The twin doors slowed parted with a sound of tiny squeals, coming from the rusty hinges of non-usage.

"Yeah, I'm always right." I exhaled with a puff of annoyance and bounced side to side with nervousness and worry.

Dfee was all alone inside the Bowl ring with seven other fighting foes, including his schooler friend Lexedo, who had been in the car accident with Igala.

The doors slowed opened up a crack and revealed the Bowl ring with hot temperatures with parted clouds of sunrays.

I slid sideways with a grunt and exited through the small crack of air between the two gates, running ahead and stopped at the edge of new concrete platform with a groan and a sour frown, looking down at the ground, "Geez! Red mud and tall trees, what kind of scary scenery is this? The natural combination doesn't make any sense to my brain senses. The Regulators are some kind of wicked and sick robots." I heard a scream through the wind and looked up with a gasp to see my foes.

On top of the Vee team platform, there were three people that included Kallidin, her mom, and her older sister. They stood in silver matching cat suits and boots together, elbowing and pointing at Igala across the way with a set of smiles and laughter.

I sneered. "So, they stayed behind without getting dirty or muddy. Why bother fighting when there was only one person? The two brothers, the dad, and Ethdamn are down there inside the mud, fighting with Dfee." I laughed with a grin. "Sorry, Lexedo! You're brothers are all dead. Dfee gotta them. I bet that you don't possess your com-d. Of course not, that's why you are not allowed a com-d to watch the process of your own Bowl event." I lifted and waved both arms in the arm at the three females with a sneer for my eardrums only. "Me or her? Her or me? I must kill. She must die. I must live. She must die, not with a T-bone steak knife, but something better." I dropped and slapped a hand down over my leg where the switchblade was hidden for my evil death plans. I leaped into the air, jumping down into the mud and landed with a smooth move. I flipped and rolled over and over inside the fluffy emerald green evening dress from the impact into the soft mud with a grunt, without hitting a tree. I slowly stood upright with a growl to see the three female Vee team members.

Lexedo slowly turned with a smile and advanced toward the edge of the platform, spinning around, climbing down the provided ladder. She landed down on top of the mud and slid to the left in the mud, grabbing the ladder for support.

I turned with a grin and slid side to side with a giggle over the mud puddle in a pair of open sandals. The re-designer sandals exposed all my toes which allowed the mud to cake and dry onto the feet soles like a pair of thick boots. I advanced ahead around the grove of trees and stopped, swinging around, waving both arms with a sneer.

Lexedo stood upright from the ladder and slowly turned, sliding side to side over the mud, slowly moving toward Igala near the grove of trees with a sneer and fell down, crawling over the mud toward Igala. She stopped and stood upright on both kneecaps. Her shiny cat suit was painted in bright red mud like blood.

I pivoted around the tree and bent down at both kneecaps over the slimy ground, slapping a forehead with the mud with the tart revelation, staring with a sneer and sour frown at Lexedo. "You set me up. You arranged the car accident at our schooler Hall. You were the first body inside my car that day of the vehicle accident. Then, all the rest of my friends followed you inside my car."

"Yeah," Lexedo slipped side to side over the mud in the pair of satin boots, popping the blue colored bubble gum, wearing a set of pucker lips on both cheekbones and a forehead. The pucker lips on the forehead moved and shifted back and forth into a real-like kiss with a soft smack. She laughed with a nod. "Finally, the smartest one figures it out. I admit you are blessed with multiple silly teen lives. But you have run out of lives, kitty darling, and will not live through this Bowl competition. We, three created the ultimate plan. Minki, of course, got greedy going first. And now, she is dead. Kallidin got too anxious next. And now, she is dead. And I am here. And now, you will die, Igala. I have learned. I have lived. I have seen. I will conquer and be awarded everything."

I stood upright and gathered the wet skirt with a worried brow, back stepping from Lexedo with a gasp and a shout. "Wolf..."

"Where?" She back stepped and swung around with a gasp, slamming the low tree branch into the nose bridge, falling backward and landed inside the mud with a puff.

I lunged on top of her chest with a sneer.

Both bodies rolled and tumbled around inside the red mud.

I lifted and planted a shoe to the right, sliding back down onto the mud, falling on top of her chest. She grunted with pain. I planted the other shoe in the mud to stand and fell down on my kneecap.

Lexedo reached out and punched the stomach of Igala with a fold fist and mouth spit of red mud.

I folded over with a cough and fell backward, hitting a back spine into the mud with a grunt, struggling to stand. She leaped and landed on top of Igala.

They tumbled over and over inside the slick mud.

I rolled Lexedo onto her back spine and then rolled onto my back spine while reaching underneath the muddy dress and the three clean and crisp crinolines and grabbed the weapon. I slid the switchblade out and tapped the button, ripping part of my elegant gown, lifting the blade tip even with her abdomen, the most common spot for a stabbing with a switch blade in a right hand, since I was right-handed.

They continued to twirl over and over inside the slick mud.

The blade was covered in slick mud between my fingers.

Her fingernails lifted and scratched the muddy face of Igala.

The blade tip soared through the mud and penetrated her cat suit with ease and hit her skin, right below the belly button into the soft gut. I pushed the blade further through the soft tissue, without touching a bone, punching the kidney.

They continued to tumble over and over inside the soft mud.

I jerked the blade deeper into her belly, feeling nothing but angry.

She felt the pain and sat upright on both kneecaps in shock. Her neurons couldn't figure out the medical problem. Then her eyeballs looked down to see the gory exposed pink tissue from her intestines, kissing the switchblade tip. The wound was a bad internal injury. Lexedo crawled forward on both kneecaps, probing the belly, jerking out the blade, applying pressure with both hands over the red colored wound that matched the red mud.

I couldn't tell the difference between the red mud and the red blood, scooting away from her.

Lexedo held the exposed red bloody gut, folding down at a waist, leaning down into the mud puddle.

I reached out and snatched up the knife from the mud, lifting into the air, seeing sparkling red blood or mud. I couldn't tell the difference or texture. I turned to see Lexedo and backed further away on both kneecaps through the soft mud, not seeing a break in her silver tinted cat suit, since the red clay covered her clothing. The switchblade cut was deep, probably affecting the muscles, the blood vessels, and the organs on Lexedo. I couldn't tell if her body parts were exposed, since the red clay mud covered the clothing and her fatal wound also.

Lexedo produced a set of clear watery tears and sobs, running down a muddy face, staring at Igala.

I couldn't see her perfect makeup anymore, only red mud. I felt only numbness within my body from the kill. My hands shook as the mud drained between fingers. I reached down and lifted the dress, replacing the closed switchblade back down into the garter belt with another surprise for another member of the Vee team member.

"Igala..."

I heard my name, moaning with the wind and then whispered, "Dfee..." I stood upright with a gasp and gathered the wet and muddy skirt into both hands, spinning around, dashing to the sound and to fight for the man that I love. I ran around the tree and hit the wall of muscle.

He dropped both the weapons and reached out, grabbing both her biceps, spinning around with a smile, cuddling her into a bloody chest with a whimper. "Beauty, why are you here in the Bowl..."

"With you..."

"With me..."

I smiled. "We're going to be together here or someplace beautiful, Dfee."

"Yeah," Dfee tumbled down as she caught him. Igala landed on the soil with Dfee inside her lap. He smiled with a grin and closed both eyelids with a set of heavy breathes into her face.

I shook his body with a gasp of fears. "What's wrong?"

He opened and closed both eyelids in exhaustion and pain with a smile and a whisper. "A salamander or a mudpuppy, it is about eight inches long and white. It has two grooves that conduct the venom which is a nerve potion from the glands. They live and thrive here inside the mud."

I gasped with worry and scanned his body, seeing on only red mud. "Are you harmed? Did it bite you? Are you poisoned? I don't understand."

"No, no, I am bruised, manly." He softly chuckled then coughed.

"It bites..."

"It sucks on and sticks onto your skin or your limb. It has teeth that latches and attaches onto anything. Then it releases the paralyzing potion."

I exhaled with a puff of understanding. "Okay, okay, yeah, a lizard, I got it. It's the special guest star inside the red mud environment of the Bowl ring. Yeah, yeah, I find a lizard and toss it on the rest of her family members for death. How many did you kill, so far, beast?"

He opened and closed his eyelids in pain and exhaustion on a sweaty face with a grin. "You are sweet for asking, beauty. I got three or five..."

I exhaled. "Okay, okay, that's means that there about three or four for me, including..." I screamed in panic.

The flying hatchet slammed and stuck into the poor tree bark, missing the cheekbone of Igala.

I dropped Dfee down against the tree trunk, hearing his painful groan and spun around, dropping down over the mud. The mud acted like a flowing river of red colored muddy water.

The Vee team member slid side to side backward from the tree with a laugh at Igala. The mom of Lexedo wear a silver tinted cat suit with a pair of matching boots, but the cat suit was covered in red mud. Part of her face was covered in red mud, too. She wore a facial design of lips that parted opened which looked like a fake scream. The forehead design parted the lips with a loud scream and then closed with a laugh, repeating the chilling scene on her forehead.

I kicked both sandals up and down, moving forward swiftly, flowing down the mud on the stomach muscles, dropping both arms down into the shallow water and bright red mud with a sneer. I was too afraid to die right now. I didn't care about losing a finger or two from a silly salamander. My hand touched something thick and slimy and as, I grunted and grabbed the yucky feeling thing. I sat back on both kneecaps and lifted up, tossing a single mudpuppy into the face of the mother of Lexedo.

The white looking mudpuppy twirled through the air and landed on a set of four clawed feet, leaning and attached a mouth of teeth onto the nose bridge of the older woman.

The mother of Lexedo screamed and stumbled backward from Igala in shock and reached up, grabbing both hands at her nose, sitting on her kneecaps down inside the mud. Then, her body became paralyzed from the nerve points, falling sideways down into the mud. Half of her face was deep inside the muddy water. She could only breathe through one nostril, without moving and still conscious with one eyeball staring at Igala.

I paddled backward from her body and stood upright with a gasp, turning away, moving from the mother of Lexedo with a sneer, "Two down and two more to go!"

Dfee leaned against the tree bark with a sigh of pain. His schooler friend Ethdamn stood in front of Dfee, holding an arm into the air and angled the raised hunting knife at the exposed rib cage of Dfee.

I ran around the tree and skidded in the mud, stopping, falling down into the mud with a gasp and a shout to the young teen. "Ethdamn, what are you doing here? You are not blood-kin to Lexedo and her biological family tree."

Ethdamn was partially covered in red mud on the new re-designer shirt and blue jeans with half a face of red mud, also. Both cheekbones possessed mud, covering the facial design. The forehead showed a set of lips with an exposed pink colored tongue. The pink tongue wiggled side to side with a soft chuckle of annoyance for any eardrums. He raised the other hand with a golden wedding ring near his smile, "Yeah, I am. I'm her newly wedded husband. We married, yesterday. We married to take everything from you, today. Then, we'll be rich and famous and never have to work a stupid re-gen job, again."

I stood upright and gathered my muddy skirt, snatching the switchblade from the garter belt with a smirk in secret. "Well, I am so sorry to say this. Your new wife is dead."

Ethdamn growled and dropped the knife, hitting the waistline of Dfee. Dfee moaned in pain.

"No." I lifted up and reared back the switchblade toward Ethdamn. My blade hit and nicked the exposed rib cage of Dfee instead. He wailed in pain.

I dropped down and shoved both hands deep down into the mud, feeling and grabbed a set of four soft and slimy mudpuppies, standing upright and lifted two handfuls of the wiggling white colored salamanders with a sneer and launched all four lizards at Ethdamn.

Each mudpuppy twirled through the air waves and landed on the different body parts of Ethdamn. He stood upright in shock and then screamed in pain when the two rows of teeth bit and sucked down into the tender flesh on his face and his arms. Then each mudpuppy released the nerve potion.

Dfee reached over and tossed his switchblade into the air. The black tinted handled twirled over and over into the air, sliding perfectly and then stuck upright with a sharp blade inside the thick mud.

Ethdamn fell sideways and embedded down into the upright switchblade into a rib cage with a sigh of death.

I dashed ahead and accidentally slid into Dfee with a gasp. He grunted in pain. I leaned down with worried heart to see all his bloody injuries. He possessed a set two black eye sockets, a busted lip, a bloody face, a set of busted ribs, and other injuries that my eyeballs could not see.

On top of the Vee team platform, the older sister of the Lexedo paced back and forth with fury. She hadn't seen or heard from any of her family members. Impossible, it was simply impossible that teen Dfee ambushed and killed her brothers. Her brothers were older and stronger. Then her younger sister Lexedo left the safety of the platform and searched for the teen Igala. Impossible, it was simply impossible that the teen Igala had killed her sister Lexedo, also. The older sister of Lexedo turned with a sneer and dashed toward the side of the platform, leaning down and grabbed the shotgun, which was only weapon inside their home for protection. It was decided to bring and to use at the last minute, since it contained only two shotgun shells for killing only two people, teens Dfee and Igala. Then the older sister would win the Bowl and nurse her biological family back to health.

She stood upright with a sneer and spun around, advancing over the concrete platform, climbing down the ladder. She slipped down into the red mud with a grunt and a gun and then stood upright, slowly stomping through the slick mud toward the two teens, Igala and Dfee.

Then, she would win the Bowl competition, becoming rich and famous, quitting her lousy re-gen job at the dish factory.

12:55 pm

Cee Building location

Regulator office setting

Ucal stood upright with a set of crossed arms and a fluttering stomach in front of the wall of glass, studying the progression of Igala in the Bowl ring inside the Regulator office of the Cee Building. He gasped with worry at the sight of the shotgun and the older sister of Lexedo on top of the Vee team platform.

Inside the Bowl arena, Igala had killed her schooler mate Lexedo, the mother of Lexedo, and her schooler mate Ethdamn. Dfee had already killed or knocked unconscious the father of Lexedo, and the two older brothers of Lexedo. Thus, there was one more member of the Vee team with a legal and deadly weapon that could wipe out both Igala and Dfee.

Ucal was deeply worried now. Igala didn't possess a better weapon but her wits and her switchblade. He also wondered where the switchblade came from but it was obviously Dfee's.

Dfee was hurt and bleeding over the tree bark and down into the red mud. He would not last too much longer.

Ucal could not count upon Dfee to sacrifice his life for Igala. Dfee was almost dead. Thus, Ucal had to come to the rescue of Igala, once again. Maybe, this last time, she would truly understand and believe the love of Ucal for her safety and her life.

He spun around with a sneer and marched ahead to the single office desk, flexing both hands into two fists and stopped with a grunt, looking down with a sour frown to see the bald head of shorter Regulator with a sneer. "This is your ploy. This is your plan. This is your doing. You save Igala, now. She has agreed to marry me and to become a Regulator, too. Save her! Save my happiness, Mother!"

The mother of Ucal looked up and turned without a smile to see a set of four Regulators underneath her command. "Kill all the other citizens inside the Bowl arena. And then bring the Cee team of teens Dfee and Igala back up into the medical ward, now. Prep all the medical robots for all the wounded." The four Regulators back stepped and spun around in silence, leaving Ucal, his mother, and the Regulator room.

Ucal back stepped with a stern face.

His mother turned droned in alto timber without emotion to Ucal. "Please, stay here with me, son."

He turned and stared at the wall of glass on the side of the room with a worried heart in silence.

She stood from the chair and back stepped from the long office desk, side stepping and turned, moving ahead, stopping and stood beside the nose profile of Ucal. She reached over and held a cupped hand in front of his shirt without a smile. "You will need and use these. I promise."

He looked down at the cupped hand of his mom with a confused brow, lifting and extended an open palm underneath her fist.

She opened the palm. The two objects silently dropped down and fell inside the cupped palm.

Ucal gasped with a smile and stared down at the two objects with a nod in silence.

01:01 pm

Bowl ring setting

Grove of trees setting with Igala and Dfee

Hot temperatures with bright sunshine

The older sister of Lexedo slipped side to side with a set of grunts, slowly searching every grove of trees, hunting for the teens, cuddling the shotgun into her breasts.

I reached out and touched the edge of my switchblade that had stuck inside his rib cage, hearing his soft moans of pain, gritting my teeth. I jerked my switchblade out from his wounded body. Dfee yelled in pain and fainted into my arms with set of soft groans. I leaned over and protected him, watching for any more Vee team members. I didn't know how many were left. Then I heard the soft grunt and the soft swish of fresh mud, coming behind my back spine. I leaned down and kissed the top of his red stained muddy hair roots, lifting up an angry face, leaning Dfee against the tree. I pulled away from his body and leaned down, swimming inside the muddy water in disguise. I moved away from the tree and Dfee, extending both arms, wiggling my finger pads for a set of mudpuppies.

The older sister of Lexedo rounded the tree with a gasp, skidding to a halt, sliding down into the mud to face Dfee. Dfee was sitting upright and leading against the tree in soft moans of pain and bloody from hair roots to finger tips with a set of closed eyelids. She slowly stood upright with a chuckle and aimed the cold barrel of the shotgun at the face of Dfee. "Well, one teen is here. Where is the other one named Igala?" She turned and scanned the nearby groves of trees and flowing mud puddles, returning back with a snigger to see Dfee. "Well, one bullet will do the job. I only got two shotgun shells inside the gun. See ya dead, Ddead!"

I stood upright near the tree on both kneecaps and held a set of four mudpuppies, wiggling within two hands with a sneer, "Hey, ugly girl!" The sister of Lexedo turned with a sneer and continued to point the cold barrel at Dfee, wearing a pair of laughing maroon colored lips on her forehead. Her cheekbones were partially covered in red mud and maroon painted lips. I reared back and tossed, releasing the four white colored slender salamanders through the air waves.

One hit the naked cheekbone of Dfee with a loud splat without sticking with a mouth of teeth. He fell over into the mud with a grunt, coming from the forceful toss of Igala and the slimy impact with the mudpuppy. The shotgun exploded out with the single bullet into the tree bark in the exact spot of Dfee.

The other three mudpuppies were true with aim at the older female. The sister of Lexedo leaned backward with a gasp, missing the attacking three mudpuppies. The mudpuppies soared down into their muddy home without injury.

I gasped at the defeat and Dfee, standing upright from the mud on my sandals and slowly turned, slipping and sliding over the mud and moved the female away from an injured Dfee. I slid around the tree into the mud with a grunt, rushing to stand again and moved ahead, holding the dress with panic.

The sister of Lexedo turned with a sneer to see Dfee. He was partially drowning inside the mud. She laughed. "I will come back to finish you off, Ddead. But first, the last shotgun shell is for your girlfriend Igala." She slowly turned in the mud, slipping and sliding side to side on a pair of slick boots, seeing ahead the partially red muddy and emerald green gown on Igala with a laugh and a shout. "Here, I come, girly."

I slipped and slid around another tree with panic. The sister of Lexedo possessed a gun with one more bullet. So, my plan was working to save Dfee. I struggled around another tree, looking behind a collar bone, seeing the sister of Lexedo. I didn't even know her name, running away from her and her shotgun. I wasn't worry about getting a shot blast in the back spine, since she would not waste the single ammunition.

The sister of Lexedo slipped down and landed on a side into the mud. The gun landed inside the mud, too. She sat upright on both kneecaps with a sneer, extending a hand to grab the shotgun. It had mud clogged inside the barrel but would expel when it shot at the other teen named Igala. She slowly stood upright and cuddled the muddy gun into a chest, slowly moving forward, slipping and sliding through the mud with a lady growl.

I continued to look back over a collar bone to see the angry female. She was still the same distance away from Igala, since her chase. I swung around with a gasp and lifted both arms, slamming into the low tree limb, stumbling forward, sliding back down into the mud with a mouth full of mud and a set of tears of fright with a whisper for my eardrums only. "I'm going to die. Get up. Move forward. Get her away from Dfee. I need to ambush her somewhere and then kill her face." I sat upright on my kneecaps, cleaning off a muddy face, moving forward, slipped and slid side to side, moving forward through the thin grove of tall trees, scanning the environment for a brilliant life-saving plan. I gasped with alert. "The platform, climb up onto the Cee team platform using the ladder. She would have to climb up after me. Then I will stand and kick the blood right out of her two nostrils. Then I will steal the shotgun and kill her face. Yeah, good plan. Yeah, great plan." I continued to move forward, slipping and sliding over the mud, feeling it between my naked toes.

The sister of Lexedo moved forward and cuddled the shotgun, slipping and sliding over the mud, seeing Igala. "You are in my sights, girly." She stopped with a gasp. "She is heading for the Cee team platform. Yeah, I would, too. Then I would cream the nose holes of the other girl climbing up the ladder. Yeah, I know your plan, girly. But I will be there first and blow off you pretty face," she bent both kneecaps and slide side to side with ease through the slick mud, veering to the side, moving ahead toward the Cee team platform first before Igala with her brilliant death plan.

I slammed into the tree bark with a grunt of pain and as, my peripheral vision saw the sister of Lexedo. She was veering away from Igala. I smiled with a gasp of reality. She was moving toward the Cee team platform first, after figuring out the brilliant life-saving plan of Igala. I leaned against the tree, gagging for air molecules, calming my panic and watched her. She was moving swifter in a new crouched pose, using her thighs to slice both the boot soles side to side like a pair of ice skates. I couldn't move my body any swifter inside the mud stained elegant long gown but I had brains to fool the stupid girl and the switchblade to defend my person. I turned with a worried brow to see the Cee team platform. It was too far away. I swung a face to see the moving girl. The sister of Lexedo was getting closer toward the platform on the far side of the grove of trees. Sometimes, I saw her body. Then, sometimes, I did not. The grove of trees was blocking her advancing movement and her eyeballs, since she was only focused on the Cee team platform.

I exhaled with a puff of defeat and death. I will not reach the Cee platform first before her. My plan was deflated. I pushed out from the tree bark with a pair of bloody hands and stood upright, gathering a handful of mud stained dress train with a gasp. The underskirt of the elegant gown glowed in an array of vivid emerald green tones that wasn't tainted with red mud. I giggled with an evil smile. "Yeah, I got a new plan, babe." I waddled up the non-stained dress in a ball and smashed it into my breasts, protecting the fresh emerald fabric and skated side to side, advancing toward a thick packet of tall trees.

The sister of Lexedo moved swiftly with a steady rhythm and watched with one eyeball on Igala. The teen slowly moved ahead, barely advancing forward in the thick elegant gown toward the Cee team platform. Then the teen disappeared from eye sight view. She gasped with a sneer and slowly turned, veering with a steady pace toward the chump of thick tress. "So we're playing hide and go seek. Ya better hide for I'm seeking you with one more bullet of death, girly."

I advanced a little further and slammed into the tree bark with a grunt, dropping down into the mud on purpose of my new brilliant plan, out of her eye sight. I slid around the front of the tree and lifted the three crinolines, exposing my naked thigh, grabbing the dried blood and mud stained switchblade, lifting it into the air. I popped the tiny button as the blade gleamed in dried blood, mud and clean silver, reaching down and sliced down into the thick gathered fabric over my breasts, partially cutting across, partially ripping off the front panel of the long skirt and exposed the first of the three white crinolines that were sorta protecting my legs.

The gathered ball of emerald green colored fabric parted and finally tore loose from the skirt dress with a loud ripping sound into my other arm. I replaced the switchblade back down into the garter belt on my thigh leg for safekeeping to kill the sister of Lexedo, after she becomes tripped and trapped in my new plan. I gently extended the loose fabric down over the wiggling mud with the glowing emerald green fabric upright facing the high tree limbs and the peaks of yellow tinted sunrays with a giggle. The fabric wiggled and waved side to side over the watery mud, shining in emerald beauty. I wanted the sister of Lexedo to believe that I was hiding behind the tall tree, but my long dress train peek-a-booed from the side, giving away my secret hiding spot like a silly fool.

Yeah, it was a lousy plan. Yeah, the sister of Lexedo would figure it out. Yeah, it was all that I comprehend and employ at the moment.

I held the edge of the ripped fabric against the tree bark with a sigh of annoyance. The healthy tree bark contains smooth tiny slants of bark, not a rough or a protruded slant to hook onto the wiggling heavy fabric of the evening gown. I needed something to tape or tack the loose fabric onto the smooth bark which would be high enough for her to see the wiggling fabric. Else, my plan was fail. Else, she would find me. Else, I would die.

I turned with a stern face and surveyed the environment within the Bowl ring, seeing mud and more mud, returning back with a sneer and a whisper to see the tree bark and the fabric. "Yeah, I had to do it. Yeah, I hated to do it. Yeah, I'm going to do it." I kicked the three crinolines the ground and lifted my thigh into the air and reached down, snatching off the switchblade with one hand, pressing the button. The blade still contained partially dried red blood and red mud. I leaned over and stabbed the tip into the top of the emerald colored fabric, anchoring the torn dress skirt onto the tree bark. The fabric held in place and wiggled side to side over the watery mud with elegancy. The switchblade gleamed in the sunrays with beauty. I exhaled with a puff of worry and back stepped from the tree, the fabric, and my weapon, feeling much lighter and dove down with two outstretched arms into the watery mud out of her eyesight. I slid and slipped side to side, kicking my legs, swiftly moving ahead back toward Dfee with swift worry.

When the sister of Lexedo saw the wiggling fabric, she would probably veer to the tree with a pretend hiding Igala and shoot first, wasting the last shotgun shell. Of course, she would possess two weapons for a final kill, the switchblade and the long metal shotgun without ammunition.

But I had the advantage of surprise, since Dfee had a switchblade too.

The sister of Lexedo skated side to side and watched the grove of trees, seeing the bright emerald green fabric with a laugh and a whisper for her eardrums only. "I see you, but you don't see me. I know that you possess a weapon, waiting on me to fail and fall into your clever trap. But I'm ready for the kill shot."

At 01:15 pm, within the grove of trees with Dfee, I swam forward through the mud and rammed into the stiff body of blue colored and dead Ethdamn with both hands and a sneer, sitting upright on both kneecaps, leaning down and searched for the embedded switchblade inside the dead body. I found and jerked it out from the dead body with a snarl, holding it upright with the particles of red blood and mud over my hand, turning with a worried brow to see Dfee.

Dfee leaned against the exposed root system of the large tree without drowning to death inside the watery mud. His eyelids were closed. His breathing was shallow. His blood spilled down into the red mud without distinction. His soft moans of pain indicated life.

Within marching distance of the Cee platform near a grove of tall trees, one tree held a piece of green colored gown fabric. The sister of Lexedo slid side to side on her kneecaps, moving over the mud and rounded the front of the tree, pointing the cold barrel of the shotgun at the emerald green fabric with a gasp. "What the fudge is this?"

At the tree with Igala and Dfee, I tossed the bloody tip of the switchblade blade into the upper bark of the tall tree for a quick access to kill the sister of Lexedo and slid over the mud on both kneecaps, ramming into the tree with a worried heart, hearing the loud speaker inside the Bowl ring.

The Zulu Time speaker blasted in the distance. _"Brood of vipers, you are condemned in Zulu Time."_

I exhaled with a puff of annoyance. "Dang, I hate that stupid phrase." I stood upright and leaned into the tree for support, and as my eyeballs narrowed to see the far and big Cee platform. I gasped with fear.

On top of the Cee team platform, a row of Regulators moved ahead from the parted steel doors and over the concrete platform and stopped, standing upright and held a weapon.

I turned with a gasp and dropped down with a worried heart, covering Dfee inside the mud for protection.

Near the Cee platform, the sister of Lexedo spun around with a gasp to see the rows of Regulators. There were three rows. The tall Regulator kneeled down first over the surface. Then the first two rows kneeled down over the platform, pointing and aimed a cold barrel at the sister of Lexedo. The tall Regulator dropped an entire body over the surface with the new silence signal.

An array of flying bullets fired with red tinted sparks, shredding the tree leaves, the tree bark, and the single upright Vee team member into silence death.

Silence filled the air waves.

The rows of Regulators moved off the Cee platform, climbing down the ladder, and advanced around the Bowl arena, scouting for the other Vee team members that were still alive and unconscious.

Underneath the tree and on top of Dfee, I gagged and coughed with tears of sob, reliving a bad life as a teen inside Zulu Time for the fourth time. I wanted to die and relief from the fear and the frustration of my bad dream. I had entered Zulu Time for the fourth time, a feat that was impossible as my granny Oltole said to me inside the glass cage. But I had done it, four times.

The hand gun went off with four bullets that echoed throughout the Bowl ring, identifying the father and one brother of Lexedo, where Dfee had knocked them unconscious, not dead.

A pair of golden colored gloves of the folded Regulator reached out and grabbed onto the naked and muddy collar bone of Igala, lifting her upright into the air and away from Dfee, standing both her sandals inside the mud.

I stood upright with a grunt of tears and sobs, watching Dfee with worry.

Four pairs of golden gloves reached over and grabbed each limb of Dfee, lifting him upward, loading him and his grunts of pain into the air and landed the limp body on top of a medical cot. The Regulator gently covered Dfee with a beige sheet that immediately turned into the color of red blood. The medical cot slowly lifted up from the mud and halted in the air, slowly flying over mud with the unconscious bloody body of Dfee.

I slowly swung around and moved behind the medical cot and the back spines of the two Regulators with a set of set of tears and worries, sliding through the mud.

At 02:02 pm (early afternoon) inside the Cee Building hallway among the man-made cool air temperatures, without bright sunlight, I gathered up the three mud stained crinolines into a big ball and cuddled them into my chest, dashing down the hallway in a pair of partially wet water and partially dried muddy spiked heels, staining the hallway without a care.

I ran behind the hovering medical cot with Dfee on top, wiping the tears from a face and the blood from an arm, where the dress didn't protect my exposed body from the vicious deadly fight inside the Bowl ring.

Dfee was unconscious and bleeding over the beige sheets of the medical cot.

The team of four Regulators marched ahead down through the dark and crowded Zulu Time hallway, shoving with sneers at each body away from a golden tinted face, advancing down the black carpet of dried blood stains toward the middle of the room. The team stopped in front of the solid wall of beige paint between two sets of semi-crowded glass cages that secretly held the entrance into the medical ward. One reached over and tapped the hidden seam of the solid wall of beige paint.

The elevator door slid opened.

The Regulator pressed a button. The medical cot with Dfee slid sideways over the air waves, and entered, halting within the air inside the small carriage.

I bumped and elbowed my way through the rough snarling crowd of protestors with my own lady growls, dashing into the small carriage, leaning over Dfee with sobs and tears of worry. I wished that my eye tears were a set of healing liquid to heal his bloody body.

Dfee was breathing with a funny sound, coughing then gagged without accepting fresh air molecules and bleed over his arms, his chest, his neck, and his stomach. The exposed beige colored sheets were colored in dark red hues of his spilled blood.

The door slid shut. The elevator lifted and moved up to the next floor. The door slid open.

02:12 pm

Zulu Building

Medical Ward location

Reception room setting

The medical cot moved sideways out from the carriage and slowly turned to face the open archway between the reception room and medical ward room, slowly flying through the air like magic, but it was controlled by the interior remote control devise inside the head medical robot of the medical ward space.

The medical cot with Dfee slowly stopped and gently lowered down toward the new floor space.

I raced behind the medical cot and reached out, dragging a single chair from the reception wall, moving ahead and stopped, sitting down inside the chair next to medical cot railing and his body. I reached out and held his hand with a fake smile, a heavy heart, and a worried whisper of tears. "I'm so sorry. I'm so stupid. I should have read all the Zulu Time rules and all the Bowl rules too. I didn't know that you could go into the Zulu Time alone. Solo. I called out that stupid word, solo. You're a stupid and smart and brave and courageous boy. And I love you, Dfee. I love you. I pick you over him. I like Ucal. I do. I love your touch and your cuddle and your kiss, so sweet."

Inside the reception room, the elevator door slid open. Ucal moved ahead with a smile and a whistle of happiness, halting inside the archway of the medical ward with a stunned face and a gasp, staring at the blood covered medical cot that contained a blood covered Dfee. "He is alive..."

I heard the words that echoed through the quite medical ward and gently replaced, resting the bloody hand of Dfee over the bed linens and stood upright, shoving the chair from my butthole, swinging around with a hiss and a sneer, advancing ahead with fury toward Ucal and stopped inside the archway of the medical ward and the reception room. I jabbed a bloody covered finger pad into his face with a sneer. "You, you were driving your hover car within the air waves which was behind my ancient automobile, tailing me, too. Then I smashed into the other driver of the hover car, an accident of a silly teen driver."

Ucal shook a skull with a smile and reached out, gently touching her biceps. "You're too smart for your own good, Igala. I participated in the car wreck. I didn't arrange all this. Someone else did. Yeah, I arranged it with my parents..."

I sneered. "I didn't need your help, Ucal. You have helped me, enough. I'm grateful for your knowledge of Zulu Time and saving my family, two times, during the Tag and the Tag Team. Thank you. You killed them. I killed them. The end!"

He nodded with a smile. "We made and make a good team. We're young teens, who think the same way, the righteous way. We'll join the Regulators against the rebellion, the fight for right and justice, Igala."

I jabbed the bloody finger into his clean T-shirt with a snarl and a sour frown. "And you talked with my grandmother. She told me the same exact words in the same exact sentence structure. You arranged for me to be saved, so you can marry me. Did my grandmother or my father give your permission slip without my knowledge, too?"

He smiled with a nod. "All..." He cleared a throat. "I wanna be honest about everything. You guessed, correctly. The car accident was a set up..."

I tossed and dropped both arms with a sour frown, slapping the wet gown of mud with a sneer. "You, you staged all that for a stupid wedding, involving me and my family. I almost died the inside Zulu Time. Then I killed. I had to kill to survive. I killed an innocent person to live. You disgust me. I wanna leave."

He nodded with a stern face. "I had to kill to survive inside Zulu Time, too, Igala. I was with you on the Tag call during the first Bowl event. I volunteered to serve with you on the Tag Team during the second Bowl event, also. I substituted for the rest of your biological family, Igala," he exhaled. "That was my first time, too. I did all that, because I love you. Please, I have a limousine ready. I will take you back home. You can think about our wedding plans for the rest of the week. You should talk with your parents about all of this, too. But, please listen to..."

The carriage elevator door slid open inside the reception room, exposing the upright individual. "Ucal..." The short Regulator stood in glittering golden tones without a smile and an emotion, seeing the nose profile of Igala and Ucal, hearing the arguing words of the teens. "May I speak with you in private? Hello, Igala! How are you feeling?"

I turned with a gasp to face the Regulator inside the carriage. "I am fine. Thanks for asking, Ucal's mom."

Ucal looked over a collar bone with a sour frown to face the Regulator into the carriage. "Yes ma'am." He turned back and leaned over, gently pecking her cheekbone, pulling back with a smile. "I'll take you home after this. Okay?"

I exhaled with a puff of confusion, frustration, betrayal, and puzzlement. "Yeah..."

Ucal spun around with a smile to see his mom and dashed into the open carriage of the single elevator with her. The elevator door closed shut.

I stood in place inside the archway and closed my eyelashes with worry and frustration with Ucal and my parents.

Her mom, Henoana talked all the time about Ucal as a great husband for Igala.

Her dad, Genic talked all the time about Ucal as a savior of the Smith family unit.

Her brother, Segue didn't say anything about Ucal, only watched the com-d and the wall of glass for entertainment purposes.

Her sister, Laddie was too young to understand love, weddings, and teens.

Her grandmother, Oltole said that Ucal was wrong.

I opened my eyelashes and spun around with a set of tears and sobs to see Dfee.

Dfee was peacefully resting inside the metal hospital bed. He was unconscious and bloody from the battle inside Zulu Time, breathing his last set of breaths with a mechanic machine. Most of his body parts including the heart and the lungs were damaged or dead.

I whispered for my eardrums. "Ucal was wrong. Ucal is wrong. I should be getting married to Dfee, right now. Dfee should be dead from all his bloody injures, but he is not. I should be dead, too. But I am not dead, either. We are still here and alive, right now. Ucal is wrong. Granny told me to think with my heart, not my mind. My mind is clogged with too many old memories that can't be purged. Think with my heart. My heart tells me so."

The single medical robot lifted up from the floor and floated through the air, hovering at the bedside of an unconscious Dfee, blinking a set of colored lights on its metal frame, tossing a blue light over Dfee, scanning the human body. "Body damage is listed at seventy-eight percent."

I whispered for my eardrums only. "My heart tells me so." I sneered at the medical robot. "That can be fixed, right?" I dashed ahead inside the medical ward room toward Dfee, stopping and stood over the opposite side of the medical cot with the chair, staring down with a worried brow at his damaged and bloody body.

The single silver tinted cylinder shaped medical robot hovered in place over the other side of the medical cot with Dfee, staring down at the patient with the flashing lights of vivid and pastel colors. "Both of the lungs are punctured and bleeding. The heart is ruptured and blooding. One of the kidneys is busted and bleeding..."

"That can be fixed, right?" I grabbed the back rest and sat down inside the same chair, reaching out, grabbing his bloody hand with a worried brow and a worried heart and held his hand with my bloody hands.

"The patient is heavily damaged..."

"I want him fixed. I love him." I growled at the metal machine and patted on his bloody hand, stroking each finger with my love, healing him with my energy with a fake smile and a worried brow. "I love you, Dfee." The tiny bones and the ligaments broke from his wrist bone. Then, his entire hand detached away from the wrist bone. I stood upright from the chair and screamed, shaking it and lifting his detached the left hand of Dfee into the air with a set of tears and wails.

The medical robot lifted and aimed a red light at the detached hand of Dfee. "That can be fixed, too."

I slowly lowered my shaky hand that contained his separated left hand, placing it over his exposed naked stomach with tears, sobs, and a lady growl. "I hate robots..."

The medical robot lifted up a closed panel within the belly of the metal, shooting outward a metal skeleton-like hand at the detached human bloody hand and exposed bone, snatching it up and back into the opening, storing it inside the cool storage of the hand transplantation. "All this can be fixed with an immediate massive transplantation of the missing or loose or damaged organs and limbs for coin."

I gasped with worry. "I don't have any coin, but I have me." I slapped a chest with a nod and a smile. "Me! Take all my free body specimens from me, now. Bleed me. Puncture me. Stab me. Abuse me. But you give to Dfee all my blood proteins, all my minerals, and all my silver of organs, now."

"That can be done for free. Take off all your dirty clothing and present your naked biological body for access." The medical robot whistled within its cylinder shaped machine metal. On the far side of the room of the opposite wall from the rows of medical beds, there was a set of square shaped medium sized metal boxes. Each box door flew open. Then a new medical robot slowly soared sideways, coming out from the dark metal box and slowly rose upright with a plume of white steam. Then, each medical robot flew forward and surrounded Igala in the center of the medical ward.

I quickly removed and tossed all the dirty clothes over the floor, standing nude, sorta muddy, and cold. All the silver tinted medical robots twinkled underneath the overhead artificial lamps and lifted up from the floor, floating in the air, surrounding her with a tiny needle inside a set of four separate metal limbs, coming from the side of the metal body frame.

The lead medical robot back flew from the medical bed with Dfee and soared sideways, sailing forward and halted in front of Igala, holding a set of eight needles on each extended metal arm in the air, saying to Igala. "The needle cannot become contaminated with a foreign substance without harming the patient."

I turned and gasped at the speaking robot. "What?"

The lead medical robot droned. "Clean the subject body!"

The overhead ceiling panel slid open and dropped down a heavy shower of fresh water, drowning the dirty blood and mud stained body of Igala. I gasped with a scream. The cold water washed away the dirt, the sweat, the tears, the blood stains, and the mud from my body. I fell and folded down at my waistline with a gasp of breath from the cold shower. I stood upright and dripped with an array of numerous clean water drops with a head of wet stinky hair and a sour frown. "I'm wet and cold. Is this going to hurt?"

"Just a pin prick..." The head medical robot droned. Then, each needle reached out and punched, stabbing into her external epidermis, entering and touched each one of her healthy organs for a tiny sliver of her life form.

I screamed in fear. I cried in pain. I prayed for hope. Then, all the robots withdraw each needle at the same time from her aching body. I dropped down and fell over the cold floor, curling into a ball with soft tears, loud sobs, and intense pain of worry, fear, and unhappiness. I loved Dfee. I wanted him to stay alive for my personal happiness.

One of the medical robots reached over and grabbed a blanket from one of the neatly presented medical beds, tossing it into the air as the blanket shifted through the air molecules and accurately landed on top of a semi-conscious Igala.

I continued to curl into a ball over the floor and reached out, grabbing and wrapped both throbbing arms around the blanket with more tears and worries.

Each medical robot swiftly spun around and floated ahead, halting and surrounding the medical cot with an unconscious and bloody Dfee in a series of soft whirls of metal. A set of steel curtains rose up from the metal floor and locked into each ceiling latch with a loud click for the quick medical operation.

Inside the reception room, the elevator door slid opened. Ucal entered the room with a happy hum, not seeing Igala inside the reception room and turned with a smile, moving into the medical ward space, halting a few feet with a gasp and a confused brow. There was a wall of solid silver tinted steel that surrounded and hid his childhood friend Dfee inside the medical cot.

Igala rested on the floor inside a curl of tears and sobs inside a white blanket.

Ucal dashed ahead with a gasp and slid down over both kneecaps, leaning over her with a worried brow and a worried heart. "Igala, are you hurt?"

"Just a little prick..." I continued to curl into a ball over the cold floor inside the blanket with a silly giggle of intense pain pricks.

He gasped with worry and gently probed her naked body with worry and care. "You're bloody. You're bleeding. Are you harmed? Are you hurt?"

I sobbed with tears on top of the floor inside the blanket, "No, no, not I. I am not bleeding. Dfit is bleeding. He is dying."

He leaned down and lifted her upright from the floor, cuddling her and the blanket into his chest with worry and care. "I know. I am so sorry, Igala. His body is too damaged. He breathes on a machine..."

I stared at the solid curtain of silver that hid the medical cot with Dfee. "Yes, there is. Yes, I provided a silver of every organ specimen for his life-saving operation. I saved him, Ucal. I saved Dfee."

He turned with a sour frown to see solid curtain of silver that hid the medical cot with Dfee. "You did. He will not make it."

I gasped. "What?"

Ucal turned with a stern face and gently kissed her forehead, pulling back with a sad face. "You did everything that you could do. I am so sorry. I am preparing for our wedding. I need to leave you for a few minutes."

I sobbed with tears. "No..."

"We need to leave. I have a limo..."

I sobbed with more tears. "No. I'm not leaving him."

He released Igala and reached down, gathering up her dirty and wet clothing from the floor with a worried brow into one arm, tossing the ball of wet clothes underneath an armpit with a smile. He stood with a stern face and cuddled Igala. "I got your wet clothing from inside the chair. Can you walk?"

"Yes." I softly moaned in pain and continued to stare at the curtain of silver tine that hid the medical cot with Dfee.

Ucal slowly spun away from the curtain of silver with Igala and moved ahead into the reception room, stopping and stood inside the middle of the room. He released Igala and leaned over, placing her wet clothes inside an empty chair with a smile. "You can change back into your clothing in here. The wall is solid metal. No one can come up the elevator, either. My mom and her team of Regulators are guarding the hidden wall panel for me. I'll go and keep Dfee company for a little while as you re-dress." He leaned over and gently kissed her forehead, pulling with a smile

"Yes." I softly moaned in pain and stared at the black tinted wall of glass which was not powered. I didn't bother to look outside the window and down into the Zulu Time room. The lights were activated which meant that there was another new group of protestors inside Zulu Time for criminal punishment of death, also.

Ucal leaned over and kissed her cheekbone, pulling back with a smile, lifting a cupped hand with a nod. "I have surprise for you." She flipped over and offered an open palm with a confused brow. He opened the fingers and rested the two objects into her wet palm with a smile. "I received them from my mom...

"Two golden rings..." I stared with a puzzled brow down at the two objects.

"Two golden wedding bands, they are wedding bands. My parents used them to marry and then became a pair of Regulators. A Regulator doesn't wear an ornament or a ring band. So, after we marry, we wear them for the night of our honeymoon. Then, the next day, we will become a new pair of Regulators like my folks. You can keep them safe until our wedding, this afternoon." He leaned over and gently pressed his lips into her forehead for love, pulling back with a smile of happiness.

"Yeah," I exhaled with a puff of confusion, worry, and puzzlement, continuing to stare down at the two twinkling golden tinted wedding band rings inside an open palm, feeling the love and happiness of Ucal.

The medical robots had finished with the medical operation on the patient. The silver curtain had dropped down and fallen back down into the cold metal floor for cleaning. All the working medical robots flew backward and soared away from the medical cot with Dfee, hanging onto the forward wall of metal in silence, monitoring the patient. The medical cot with Dfee was exposed within the air waves.

He smiled. "Get dressed in here. Then, we'll leave from the Zulu Time campus and buy you some new clothing and prepare for our wedding, before we become a new team of Regulators. I love you, Igala. I'm so happy." He back stepped with a smile and spun around with a hum, slowly strolling back into the medical room and stopped, standing over Dfee inside the medical cot. He leaned down with a smile over Dfee. Ucal could see the outline of blood trails, coming from the numerous insertions points of new organs and various pale skin tissues on the naked chest of Dfee, where Igala had nicely volunteered and then was extracted from her body for free with the medical surgery.

Ucal whispered into the cheekbone of Dfee with a smile. "I'm sorry, Dfee. I hope you don't make it and then die, passing into a new life of happiness and peace. We live in a violent Society. But you know that. It's better this way really for you. You don't know this new information. Your parents are dead. The protesters invaded your personal home and snatched away your parents and your baby sister by the throat, literally. All the protestors have deemed you, a criminal for successfully escaping from the Bowl arena, yesterday. Your parents were deemed as a criminal family, also. The heads of your family members are hanging on top of an individual pike inside the hands of an individual protestor, looking scary and creepy out the dark tinted windows here at Zulu Time. I won't be able to sleep for the next three nights, bro. Anyways, I will be protecting and marrying my girl Igala. She saved herself and you inside the Bowl. But you know that. She's a brave and beautiful girl. I'm a lucky guy. You're a dead guy. I'm sorry, Dfee. The 'bestest' man won. That's me. Farewell, bro!" He reached over and slapped the bicep of Dfee. Dfee softly moaned in pain. Ucal slowly back stepped away with a gasp of shock and stared down at an unconscious Dfee.

Dfee did not move a muscle from the sleepy medication and the numerous exposed and sewn up wounds over his chest, his stomach, and his face while resting inside the medical cot, breathing with a set of funny sounds.

"Ucal...."

Ucal spun around with a gasp to see Igala in the wet and mud stained torn emerald green dress. She was standing inside the archway with a smile. He moved ahead with a smile, stopping and stood in front of her, leaning down to kiss her lips. He pulled back with a wink and a smile. "You taste, so sweet."

The lead medical robot detached from the forward wall and sailed ahead, passing the medical cot with the unconscious body of Dfee, flying toward the back spine on Ucal in silence.

"Thank you." I exhaled with a puff of worry. "Is Dfee alive and well?"

The medical robot halted and hovered beside the nose profile of Ucal, saying to Igala. "He is more damaged."

I gasped with a sneer at the lead medical robot. "What, what does that mean? I don't understand your stupid statement. I gave..."

The medical robot droned with a set of red and yellow colored flashing lights. "The organs of teen Igala are not comparable with the blood proteins of teen Dfee. He will not make it. He is only functioning at eighteen percent of life."

Ucal cuddled and kissed her wet cheekbone, pulling back with a sad frown and a whisper. "I am so sorry, Igala. You tried everything. You're a wonderful friend..."

"Girlfriend..." I whispered for my eardrums only and flooded a face with tears of sadness. Dfee was going to die. Then I was going to marry Ucal and become a Regulator. I had placed both the wedding bands inside the tiny pouch of the elegant and torn gown out of sight, trying to forget about marrying Ucal. I loved Dfee. I wanted to marry Dfee and live happily ever after.

Inside the reception room, the elevator door slid opened.

"Ucal..." the short Regulator stood inside the carriage and motioned with a hand without a smile to her son again.

Ucal looked up with a smile to see his golden tinted mom again with a nod, "Mom..."

"I need you to justify your cause with the other Regulators. Please, come with me, son."

"Yes ma'am," he leaned over and kissed her lips, pulling back with a smile and a whisper. "Keep our wedding bands safe. We will be getting married very soon and then we'll become one. I love you, Igala."

"I..." hesitated with the same sentence structure.

"Ucal, please come, now," the mom of Ucal continued to stand inside the carriage without a smile.

Ucal back stepped with a smile and side stepped, dashing into the carriage. The door slid shut.

I continued to sob with tears with a worried heart and stared with a sad face at the medical bed, where an unconscious Dfee rested and breathed on a mechanic machine, again. The room was quiet, except for the thumping of the metal paddle inside the breathing machine. I was watching and waiting for Dfee to die. I had been too late, jumping down into the Bowl ring with my set of one deadly weapon. His physical body had been badly beaten and bleeding over the grass, the dead mudpuppies, and my hands. I exhaled with puff of defeat.

The medical robot floated within the air waves, blocking Igala, blinking in pink and green colors over its metal body. "I have the specimen slivers."

I turned and gasped at the robot. "What?"

The lead medical robot sailed backward from Igala and halted in the air. A set of metal panels on its body opened up, down, and sideways. Then, a set of eight skeleton-like limbs jerked out from each metal pocket into the air. On each side wall within the medical ward space, there were rows and rows of tiny metal boxes. Each tiny metal box opened and revealed a wrapped object inside the cold and dark interior.

I turned with a gasp and narrowed my eyelashes at one of the tiny boxes with a single object of pinkish tint, "A heart? Where did that heart come from?"

"Each person on the wall of criminals is a donor."

I turned and gasped with shock at the robot and then looked within more of the open tiny boxes, touching my throat with a sour frown. "I understand, too late. The tan and red tape around each criminal, it holds the blood proteins, the skin tissues, and the organs intact of each criminal. You raped the organs, coming from each dead body."

"The body is deceased."

I turned and sneered at the robot. "You're a vicious machine."

"I am a medical machine. He is a teen human. I need payment in coin for a life-saving surgery on the teen named Dfee."

I gasped. "What?"

"I need payment in coin..."

"Coins, coins, yes," I gasped with a nod. "Coins, coins, yes," I ran forward and slammed into the medical cot. Dfee softly groaned from the violent impact of her body slam. I leaned over and searched the torn and ripped pockets of his blue jeans for a collector bar with a worried brow, feeling the item, jerking it upward from the torn pocket with a smile. "Here, here." I turned with a worried brow and scanned the medical ward room. I located the coin machine inside the wall corner near the wall of viewing windows for such an urgent medical operation. "Yes, yes, coin, coin." I dashed ahead and slammed into the coin machine against the wall of windows with a grunt, placing the collector bar into the slot with a nod and a smile. "How much is the operation? How much to fix all the transplantation organs and limbs right now? I can pay. I can pay for it all right now. Yeah, I can."

"Very much," The medical robot spun around from the reception room archway and flew over the floor, halting at the back spine on Igala.

I pressed the button and heard a soft click of activation, back stepping with a smile for the robot to view the screen, pointing down with a nod at the collector bar. The collector bar had collected all the coin, coming from my exhibition on the short-lived Tour of Zulu Time with Ucal over the past three days. "See, here? See the coin? Is that enough?" I jabbed a finger at the coin machine with a nod and a smile of happiness, saving the life of my love Dfee.

The medical robot flew ahead and halted beside the coin machine, extending a single skeleton-like finger into the receiving slot, flashing in colors of purple and gray over its metal body. "The number zero is not enough." The robot withdrew the metal finger and flashed lights of orange and yellow.

"What?" I dashed ahead with a gasp and a worried brow and slammed into the coin machine to see the exterior screen. The collector bar of coin showed the amount of zero. I looked up with a gasp to see the pretty day and the gangs of protestors in front of the Zulu Time Building with a set of colorful signs. "No, Mama!" I spun around and dashed back to Dfee, slamming into the metal bed, searching the other dirty and torn pockets of his blue jeans with a heavy heart and felt the new bump, grabbing and lifted up a second collector bar with a sigh. "Yes, yes, coin, coin," I swung around with a worried brow and slammed into the coin machine with a grunt again, reaching over and grabbed the first collector bar, yanking it out. I tossed the first collector bar against the floor as it dropped and landed against the wall with a tiny ting. I reached down and fiddled with the second collector bar, placing it back into the reading slot and pressed the button with an evil laugh and a wicked smile. The screen showed coin. "See, see here! I have coin."

The robot extended forward and jammed the same metal finger back into the side slot of the coin machine for a second time, blinking in colors of purple and gray again. "Yes, it will be the full payment. Then the collector bar will be emptied. Is that your desire?" The medical robot droned in metal music.

I nodded with a smile at the coin machine. "Yes, my desire, my wish, my command. Do it to him, now." I turned and growled down at the metal machine, watching its actions.

The medical robot flashed in the colors of brown and black and transferred the entire coin into the account of Zulu Time rapidly, withdrawing the metal finger back into the metal compartment. The compartment closed shut. The medical robot spun around and sailed ahead through the air waves, producing a whistle sound. The other assortment of tall, medium, short, and tiny metal robots sailed from the forward wall of metal, surrounding the medical cot with Dfee for a second time The floor panel opened up sideways around the medical cot, lifting up a black heavy screen that attached to the ceiling by a set of thin wires which didn't cover the ceiling.

I turned with a gasp of fear and heard the sounds, buzzing of the machines, the draining of sucking blood, and the sawing of bone fragments. I reached up and covered both eardrums, slowly moving sideways and away from the terrible sounds, the hidden medical cot, and the working robots, strolling backward into the reception room. I could see his individual particles of flying red blood proteins and tiny pink tissues within the air. Each blood protein leaped up and over the black curtain and into the air, hitting and sticking onto the silver metal colored ceiling with a tiny sizzle.

I covered my lips with tears and sobs with a whisper of defeat. "He is going to die. He won't make it. He's too weak. I tried so hard to save him. I'm so sorry for failing you, Dfee. I love you. I love you so much with my heart and my soul." I back pedaled from the black curtain, hearing an assortment of musical buzzing, sawing, grinding, clipping, clicking, sucking, and other horrible sounds. I hit the entrance wall with open metal boxes in pain, sliding down over the floor and dropped a worried face into both hands, crying with love.

02:40 pm

Regulator office setting

Ucal spun around and moved away with a smile from the huddle of regulators inside the office. The group of Regulators had agreed to accept Igala as his wife. Then they would morph them into a couple of golden tinted Regulators within a few seconds. He stopped and stood, leaning down over her hair roots with a grin of happiness. "Thank you for everything. It is time for my happiness, now." He scooted around his mom and moved toward the wooden closed door inside the Regulator office.

She turned and frowned at the back spine on her son. She was happy about his chosen female for life. Igala proved beyond any doubt as a strong and brave Regulator. However, the coin held two sides, "What about your boyhood friend Dfee, son?"

He halted in place and exhaled with a huff of sadness, staring down with a stern face at the polished wooden floor. "It is time for his happiness, too." Ucal moved forward, slamming open the wooden door, dashing down the hallway with a smile to fetch his girl Igala for their wedding ceremony within a few minutes.

02:41 pm

Medical ward room setting

The black curtain detached down from ceiling and dropped back down into the open floor. The floor closed shut.

The lead medical robot lifted from the floor and soared backward, flying sideways and moved to see the black hair root of Igala on the floor, halting inside the air waves. "He will live now."

I stood upright with a smile and dashed forward, slamming into the same metal cot with a grunt. Dfee softly giggled from the heavy medication without opening his eyelids. I leaned down and wiped the fresh blood from his face, kneeling and silently praying over the medical bed with a smile and a whisper into his eardrum, holding his bloody hand from the fight inside the Bowl ring. "Beast, I'm here. Just sleep, Dfee. I will never leave you, ever. The medical robots, they fixed ya up good and better than before like new, almost."

The lead medical robot back flew and turned to face the medical cot, flying ahead and stopped at the edge of the medical bed, staring down at the patient in silence.

02:43 pm

Cee Team hallway setting

Ucal turned the wall corner with a smile and a whistle of happiness and stopped inside the archway of the Cee team hallway.

The Cee team hallway of black carpet and beige walls was filled with gangs of yelling protestors and fighting Regulators, beating up each other.

Ucal exhaled with a puff of frustration. "None of you are keeping from my girl Igala." He moved ahead and shoved one body after another from an angry face, racing toward the hidden elevator within the hidden wall that traveled up to the next floor, the medical ward room.

The fist sailed from the side and rammed into the jaw line of Ucal.

Ucal tripped over both feet and lost his balance, traveling sideways from the protestor, slamming a shoulder into another protestor and wiped off the fresh blood from a nostril with a growl. "O. That was not bad. But, I'm better, buddy." He stood upright and dove into the crowd, swinging a pair of folded fists.

02:46 pm

Medical ward room setting

He whispered with a silly grin into her smile, "Igala." Dfee blinked his eyelids open and then shut from the heavy medication. "I..."

I leaned down with a smile and a whisper into his newly skin patched cheekbone. "I love you, Dfee. Do you believe me, beast?"

He blinked open his eyelids and stared into her aqua colored eyes with a goofy grin. "I..."

"I'm going to send you to a place, a beautiful place like beautiful you, too."

"I..."

"I am holding your new hand, beast. Can you see your new hand?"

"I..."

"I want to marry you and take you to a beautiful place, a safe place without violence, my beast."

"I..."

"Yes, I do, too." I turned with a lade growl to see the lead medical robot at the foot of the medical cot. "He said the words, I do, to me. Marry us, now!" I lifted the dress and reached inside for the tiny pouch, pulling out the two wedding rings of twinkling gold with a smile of love.

The lead medical robot stared down at Dfee, who appeared healthy and funny-looking. "He needs rest and fluids before any type of..."

I growled. "Marry us, now!" I reached over and placed one wedding band on the ring finger of my left hand. Then, I lifted his new left hand, pushing the second wedding band onto his ring finger with a grin and a giggle. I was getting married, finally.

The medical robot stared down at Dfee and covered his body in a series of multiple colored bright and vivid lights, coming from its metal frame. "I hold the authority to union this new couple, today. You are married. Be happy, new wife and new husband." It jerked out a set of four metal limbs and twisted the metal fingers on each hand. The overhead sprinkle system gently dropped a light shower of sprinkled water, coming down from the ceiling and falling over the heads of Igala and Dfee.

During the light raindrops, I leaned over and gently kissed his soft lips, pulling back with a smile and whisper to Dfee. "I love you, Dfee."

02:48 pm

Cee Team hallway setting

Another protester shoved Ucal with a sneer toward the solid wall between the two sets of glass cages. The cages contained imprisoned protestors, who yelled and pointed at Ucal with sneers.

However, you could not hear the sneers or the snarls, only see the finger pointing.

Ucal stood upright with a snarl and a sour frown. "Fine! I'll join your attitude." He reared back and slammed a folded fist into the jaw line of the protestor, pulling back a left bloody hand with a growl, hitting the hidden seam of the solid wall with a pointy elbow.

The elevator door slide open.

Ucal fell backward in shock and landed onto a butthole with a gasp. The overhead water system powered on, lightly sprinkling fresh water over Ucal, washing away the blood and the fury. He lifted a boot heel and hit the button with a sigh, dropping down the leg, leaning into the wall with a chuckle and a smile of fighting fun.

The elevator door slid shut. The carriage lifted upward to the next level, the medical ward. The door slide open.

02:59 pm

Medical Ward room setting

Ucal stood upright with smile and shook a wet body with a chuckle, dashing ahead without the bloody face and hands, stopping inside the archway with a gasp. Dfee was still resting inside the medical cot. Igala was still sitting inside a chair next to him. Ucal exhaled with a puff of annoyance. "Dang! That dead boy ain't dead yet. I can't believe Dfee. He must have nine lives like a stray cat." He strutted ahead with a stern face and knelt, grabbing her other hand and patted it, looking at Dfee. "He will not make it."

I turned with a gasp to see the shoulder length strawberry blonde colored hair roots of Ucal. "Ucal, I..."

Ucal stared down at Dfee with a sad face. "You did everything that you could do. You're not alone, Igala. I'm here for you, with you, by you. Your healing has begun. You will find as you get older all people die, including the family unit, which consists of mom, dad, sister, brother, grandparents, cousins, even the neighbor friends and the pet doggie. This is part of Society. This is part of your life."

I laughed with an evil laugh and a wicked grin at his nose profile. "He will live and love again for me. I used all the wrongly collected coins of my biological parents to pay and replace all his organs, his tissues, his blood proteins, and the other bodily transplants. Dfee will be fit and funny again for me."

He stood upright with a gasp and stared down at the black hair roots on Igala. "Why did you do that, Igala? Your parents are poor, now. They..." Ucal exhaled. "I cannot let you do that."

I stood upright and turned with a sneer to see Ucal. "What are you talking about, Ucal? I'm doing this for him, not you."

His eyeballs darted to Dfee inside the metal bed with a stern face. "Dfee barely breathes. The transplantation will eventually kill him." Dfee was colored in multiple skin tones of black, brown, red, yellow, white, and pink, where the medical robots had sewn a new organ inside the interior damaged body of Dfee. Then, the medical robots had graphed an array of different pieces of colored skin, coming from the numerous dead donors on the wall of criminals from previous Zulu Times. The skin patches were outlined in the earth mineral of gold, since the mineral gold was a natural healing element on a human.

Dfee looked funny with the pieces of gold and the different colors of new skin over his glowing new body. The gold threads would eventually dissolve into small particles of dust as the human skin healed and overlapped into new tissue. Thus, Dfee looked kinda funny, but Ucal wasn't going to laugh at his friend's dead funeral.

I smiled. "He is alive. He will stay alive." I reached out and grabbed the arm of Ucal, twirling toward the far wall of viewing windows and stopped. I reached up and slammed a hand into the window. The window broke, exposing the grounds and the loud noise. I pointed down with a sneer at the angry mod of people. "Look at them! Look at the blood-lust! They're the killers, criminals, and murderers. They will not leave Dfee alone or alive. Hear them, Ucal?"

"Zulu Time, Zulu Time, Zulu Time..." each citizen chanted in unison, bouncing a set of the red blood covered signs and the human heads of the dead in the air, standing outside all three Zulu Time Buildings and then spilled over into the city streets and beyond. All the citizens of Society City Four were represented and present here at the Zulu Time campus, including moms, dads, elderly, teens, children, and infants.

I growled. "They have hunted. They will hunt, again. They demand Zulu Time again and again and again. How many times does Dfee have to fight to live and survive Zulu Time? They created Dfee. Now, they want to punish Dfee. I will not allow it, never, ever."

Ucal back stepped from the broken window with a sigh of defeat, disappointment, angry, and fury, and sorrow, and sadness, seeing the angry mod and the human heads of the dead, too.

I leaned against the solid window pane, feeling the hot temperatures on the glass, seeing each skull on top of a pole pike. Each human skull possessed a set of black colored hair, a pair of aqua eyes, an open mouth of terror, and a set of exposed earlobes which represented the rest of my family members.

The skull of her mom Henoana still wore the emerald gem stone tiara on top of the black colored hair roots.

The skull of her dad, Genic still wore the emerald gem stone horizontal band over the wide pale tinted forehead.

The skull of her brother Segue still wore the clipped on nose ring of emerald gems.

The skull of her sister Laddie still wore the hair band of emerald gems over the top of her black colored hair roots.

The skull of her grandmother Oltole still wore the pair of long emerald earrings on each earlobe that dangled back and forth within the pretty sunlight, when the pike pole bounced side to side.

I didn't see the other part of the entire body. I guessed that their headless bodies were inside the burnt house or inside the damaged limousine or somewhere else. Now, my family was dead. They would not have to attend Zulu Time again.

The mode of angry citizens of Society City Four had hunted down and killed my family in cold blood, since I had been proclaimed as a criminal of Zulu Time along with my new husband Dfee. I sneered into the glass. "I will take Dfee away from here to a very safe place. They cannot find him or hunt him or have him ever, again. I hate Zulu Time and the Zulu Time rules, the Tag, the Tag Team, and the Solo command concepts."

Ucal shook a skull with a sigh and a sour frown. "He doesn't deserve them."

I sneered into the window. "I deserve him."

He looked down with a sad face to see the floor and exhaled a long huff of heartache, turning with a stern face to see the nose profile of Igala with a nod and a whisper. "I understand, too late. But, the citizens haven't killed Dfee, yet. The citizens want to murder Dfee for their pious pity problems for a sorry boring life. They don't want happy, only lost in misery, and then sharing it in violence and blood and cheer of Zulu Time. The citizens desire drama. Drama of an innocent soul lost. I will not allow them to enjoy anymore vile pleasure with Dfee." He leaned over and kissed her cheekbone, pulling back with a smile and a wink of whisper. "I do truly love you, Igala. But I have a new mission for me, you, and Dfee." He back stepped from the window and Igala with a broken heart, not a broke promise, swinging around with a stern face to see his mom.

I exhaled with a puff of heartbreak and wrapped two arms around a body with a sad face, feeling cold, angry, unhappy, relief, glad, sad, joy, worry, and hope, back stepping from the broken window and each wiggling pike pole with a human skull that represented mine and Dfee's biological family unit. I swung around and stared into a wall of muscle with a gasp.

Eimeria stood in place and blocked Igala without a smile or a facial emotion, after becoming a new golden tinted colored Regulator. "Life is hard. But death is the hardest thing for me to comprehend, since it is forever." She exhaled and inhaled with a set of interior mixed emotions of loss, sadness, hatred, relief, confusion, angry, fury, and survival while reaching up and touched a bald head of golden hue. She dropped both hands and leaned over with a whisper into the face of Igala. "Thank you, Igala! He loved you, very much. But you have graciously surrendered him to me. I have loved Ucal since the age of nine years old when we played on the swing set inside my back yard. I dreamed of marrying him and becoming a Regulator. I am so very grateful, foreverly. I promise to protect and love Ucal always within my heart and my soul. And I wish you and Dfee the most happiness." She stood upright without a smile but with a silence nod to Igala.

In front of the reception room archway, Ucal stood with both feet apart and closed eyelids, feeling a bag of mixed emotions of disappointment, love, sadness, happiness, fear, bravery, promise, and hope. He had briefly felt an eternal love, but it was not meant to be. He sneered inside the quiet room. "I'm ready."

"Thank you, Eimeria. I will be happy with Dfee, too. You go and do your thing with Ucal, Regulator." I reached up and slapped her bicep with a smile and a nod, scooting around new Regulator Eimeria with peace of mind, moving back with a smile to see Dfee.

"Ucal, please sit over here inside the chair." His mother, the short Regulator pointed down the single metal chair inside the middle of the medical ward room. Ucal sat down and closed his eyelids, imprinting the image of Igala into his memory forever, hearing the equipment buzz. He worked hard to acquire Igala for his evil plan. It backfired due to true love.

Igala loved Dfee, not Ucal. She had saved the life of Dfee and sacrificed everything for love.

The mom of Ucal lowered the razor and shaved off all the long and curly strawberry blonde locks from the nape up to the wide forehead. Each pretty lock dumped down over the floor.

Ucal remained calm and controlled with his new purpose of his new life.

On the opposite side of the room, Dfee rested inside the medical bed with a set of closed eyelids and a silly smirk from the pleasant medication from the medical surgery. His repaired biological body would heal over the next few weeks into a healthy new man.

Humans were not machines.

I dashed with a smile, without slamming into the metal bed, staring down at my newlywed husband and leaned over and tickled his naked belly button with a giggle.

His eyelids blinked open with a goofy smile to see her smile and whispered with a croak from the swift surgery operation. "Why am I alive? What am I doing here? Why are you here, beauty?"

I leaned over and smiled into his multiple colored patch work of skin tones on his handsome face. "I own you, now, boy. I saved your life. I replaced all your inner organs and your hand." I turned with a giggle and stared at the space between his legs that was underneath a bed linen. "And I hope that body part works perfectly, too. Or do I need to replace it, too?" I returned my smile at his puzzled brow.

"Naw, it works. I promise." He grunted with a moan.

"I had to replace that hand. I hope it does not ever come off."

He looked down with a gasp, "My hand?"

"Your ring on your new left hand that will never ever come off, either," I smiled.

In the middle of the room, Regulator Eimeria moved ahead and stood beside the other eardrum of Ucal. His strawberry blonde colored hair was gone, chopped off, dropped down, and landed over the tile. She said out loud. "Repeat after me! I am going to be a Regulator for Society City Four. I am going to obey and learn all the laws that regulate within Society City Four..."

Inside the medical cot, Dfee stared down with a puzzled brow at the wedding ring. "What is this?"

I reached out and touched his replaced let hand which was the color of white, not dark brown with a smile. "It is your wedding band. We are married, now."

"What, a band of marriage?" He gasped with shock.

I giggled. "Before your body organ and hand transplantation of many tones of colors, I wanted a husband that really works."

He chuckled. "Yeah, I work in different shades of coloring, also. So now, how do we get outta of here? I can hear the chanting through the broken window which ain't a holiday song for peace and celebration. And hey, I did not break that window. I promise. I broke my hand. But, it works, now." He exhaled. "And my family..."

"And, my family, too," I exhaled with a puff of sadness.

The gang of angry protesters had captured and killed my individual family members.

"We are a new family, me and you." I leaned over and gently kissed his lips, foreverly.

In front of the reception room archway, Ucal stood and removed the waist com-d, since a Regulator did not wear an ornament or a piece of jewelry for non-identification purposes. He accepted the pill and then swallowed it. The pill would chemically alter his skin tone into a shimmery copper for a non-identification purpose too. The effect of the pill was immediately like magic. Ucal quickly and quietly morphed into a coppery tone on an exposed naked chest and two biceps.

His mother handed a pair of silver sunglasses to her son, covering the eyes for non-identification purpose also.

Ucal stood in place without a smile and an emotion, saying out loud to the windows and the occupants of the medical ward. "I am the Regulator. I will regulator all claims against the innocent. I will never allow another individual to fall into my childhood friend's doom again. This is the only way to control the blood thirsty masses, my way."

New Regulator Eimeria continued to stand next to his golden nose profile with a gasp. "You don't sound like you're coming back, Ucal."

"I am a Regulator. Now, I will escort the newlyweds of Igala and Dfee on their wedding day away from the campus of Zulu Time." Ucal stared with a pair of golden tinted eyeballs that were sensitive to the light at Dfee and Igala.

Eimeria gasped. "How can you do that?"

"My way," Regulator Ucal sneered in golden sparkling colors.

Eimeria reached and touched his arm with a nod. "Then, I'm coming with you with my golden arm of Regulator protection, too."

He turned and nodded without smile and an emotion. "I, welcome your golden touch, Eimeria!" Ucal moved ahead without a smile over the floor and stopped, standing beside the metal bed of Dfee.

Igala stood upright and pulled back with a smile from Dfee, turning with a gasp.

Ucal shoved the chair to the side and leaned down, grabbing the weakened body of his friend without a human grunt sound from the new superhuman strength, lifting up and then cuddled Dfee with the bed blankets into a golden jumpsuit. He spun around and dashed toward the single elevator.

I spun around with a worry within my mental thoughts of escaping out from the Zulu Time building within the gang of violent protestors and the team of fighting Regulators. I dashed beside Eimeria who was calm and tinkled in golden hues.

I and Eimeria entered the carriage and stood behind the back spine on Regulator Ucal.

The door slid closed. The carriage swiftly dropped down and halted, opening the door.

03:13 pm

Cee Team hallway setting

The smell of old sweat and fresh blood was overwhelming to my regular scents.

Eimeria swung around from the rear wall with a loud sneeze while shoving a gang of protesters from the open archway with a sneer, sending the people into a group of fighting Regulators.

Each Regulator tumbled forward or turned around, beating upon each protester with fists and blood.

I swung around from the rear wall with a gasp and viewed the fighting, holding my nose from the awful smell of sweat and blood.

Ucal shuffled backward from the rear wall with a yell. "Run now, Eimeria! Go with Igala and move through Vee Building where the mod of violent protestors is less. And protect her, if need be..."

Eimeria reached over and lifted a hand gun into her face, reaching out and grabbed the arm on Igala, turning with a sneer, dragging Igala through the fighting crowd.

I gathered the front of the skirt and moved slightly behind the back spine on Eimeria, elbowing and shoving each heated body from my face with a lady sneer, pushing my way through the crowded hallway.

The gang of protesters yelled and punched with both fists and other objects on the rows of Regulators. The Regulators fought back with fists and other objects at the huddles of protestors.

I didn't know which group was winning the battle and I didn't care with a scream.

Eimeria stopped and back stepped into Igala with a sneer, lifting and aimed the hand gun, firing at the advancing protesters. The bullets killed a face. The rest of the live protestors back stepped with panic and shoved the twin doors of the Vee Building shut.

Eimeria exhaled with a puff of annoyance and aimed the hand gun at the middle of the wood, firing an array of bullets with an array of yellow sparks. The door swiftly parted with a set of decorated red colored blood splatters. She lifted her golden tinted leg and kicked open the rest of door with a growl, running ahead, without Igala.

03:16 pm

Vee Building location

Pink marble tinted hallway setting

I gasped at the violence and ran behind the back spine on Eimeria with panic and for safety.

Eimeria aimed the hand gun and fired into the angry crowd, killing more faces, parting the crowd. The stunned crowd back stepped in panic and cleared the pink hallway or cowered near the tombs of the dead against the pink marble wall away from the Regulator with the hand gun.

Ucal exited the Cee team hallway and followed behind the back spine on Igala into the Vee Building, toting an unconscious Dfee in both of his arms.

The entranceway twin doors closed shut with a loud boom inside the Vee Building. The protesters locked the occupants inside the hallway and bolted the doors shut, celebrating with cheers and claps of victory outdoors in the bright sunlight.

Ucal pulled up Eimeria with a worried brow and offered a weakened Dfee towards a strong Eimeria with his new command. "Run now! Go and take my hover car! It's parked next to this building inside the thick forestlands. Get out them outta here now. Go to the grandfather of Dfee, the farm homestead is located inside Dead Man's Land..."

"I can't," she turned and gasped with worry to Ucal, not accepting Dfee.

I dashed ahead and slammed into the double doors with a grunt, pulling on the handles, shouting out loud in panic and fear. "I can't. The doors are bolted from the outside. The protesters have locked us inside. We can't get out of the building unless we return back and fight our way through the dangerous Cee team hallway near the Zulu Time room." I reached up and probed the doors for a hinge with worry and fear.

Inside the hallway, Ucal turned and nodded back down at a narrow dark hallway between the two wooden walls. "You can and you will. There is a narrow hallway that leads into a thin wall. Fire at the solid wall! The wall will collapse open and fall down over the green and flower beds, revealing an ancient hiking trail that leads into the forestlands. Exit through the opening with Dfee and Igala. His grandfather is there at the eastern set of steel gates to greet and meet you and his grandson and Igala. Don't worry! When you come back, we honor our golden hands in marriage, Eimeria, gorgeous."

Eimeria nodded without a smile in silence and took Dfee with a set of her enhanced human strength arm muscles, toting him, swinging around to face the narrow hallway with intrigue.

Ucal turned and smiled at the back spine on Igala, shouting out loud. "I...wish you and Dfee happiness, Igala."

I spun around from the solid wall with worry and dashed ahead with a stern face and then stopped, standing in front of new golden tinted Regulator Ucal.

He exhaled with worry. "And I need to give you this." He lifted up and extended his personal hand gun to her with a stern face.

I gasped with worry. "Why? I can't kill another life form."

He laughed. "I know that. You need to shoot out the solid wall for Eimeria, since she carries an unconscious Dfee. Then, ya'll need to dash out and go toward my hover car for safety from the crowds of Society City Four."

I moved forward and batted the gun to the side, leaning over, kissing the golden tinted cold-fleshy cheekbone of Ucal and pulled back with a wink. "Thank you, Ucal! I...wish you and Eimeria happiness, too."

I slowly extended a hand and touched the cold metal on the hand gun, holding it in front of my breasts with a worried brow and spun around to face the narrow passageway. The passageway was wide enough for one single sideways body.

I ran ahead and entered the dark hallway of solid wood and stopped a few feet, aiming the hand gun at the solid wall, firing an array of bullets. The solid wall cracked and split into small pieces and then larger chunks, dropping down, falling into the wooden.

03:21 pm

Side door setting

Outside warm temperatures with bright sunlight

I dashed ahead and entered the bright sunshine with the gun for the safety of Dfee, stopping, stepping aside, allowing Eimeria to lead toward the hover car. I turned and followed with a worried brow behind the back spine on the Regulator into the thick woodlands, disappearing through the green lush leaves.

The entranceway twin doors slid open.

Ucal turned with a smile and looked down the narrow passageway, through the open archway, seeing the emerald green fabric dress on Igala and exhaled with a puff of happiness, squinting from the bright sunray. He heard the gun shot. Then his body flung backward from the entrance doors, dropping down, sliding over the hard pink marble floor with a grunt of pain and a bloody shoulder with a soft curse.

The crowd of angry mod stormed and stomped through the double door archway of the Vee Building, tossing rocks, club, knives, and fruit pieces at new Regulator Ucal.

A short golden colored Regulator ran down the pink colored marble floor and discharged an array of bullets from her double hand guns into each face with death and injury. The blood flew into the air as each bodies fell down over the ground and the other protesters.

She stopped and stood over her son for protection and love, looking down to see his wink of good health and then returned back with a sneer into the advancing crowd. "Back off or die!" She fired another bullet, kissing another face with death. "Back off or die! Back off or die!"

Three rows of more Regulators dashed ahead and stopped, standing beside her, firing with an array of bullet into the mod of angry citizens of Society City Four, creating more death and injury.

It will never end......
